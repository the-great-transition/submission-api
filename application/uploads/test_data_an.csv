"2019-09-19 11:07:02",Communication,"I'll Remember you in a Streetlight: data, temporality, and the spectral city","Rapid urbanization has meant that cities around the world must deal with problems like traffic congestion, aging infrastructure, affordable housing, and climate change. Increasingly, policymakers are turning to investments in technology and digital infrastructure to address these problems. Yet the move towards so-called """"smart cities"""" is not simply responsive, and policymakers increasingly advocate for smart city initiatives as a necessary step towards objective, efficient, and rational governance. This understanding of technological interventions as inherently progressive, however, causes many to overlook the erasures, biases, and limitations that emerge from trying to leave the past behind. As the problems associated with this enthusiasm become more apparent, the smart city movement must therefore recalibrate its relationship to not just technology, but time itself. Building on deconstructive temporalities emerging out of quantum physics, I argue that cities must begin drawing from alternative temporalities more open to the intersections between past, present, and future. As such, I suggest that the time has come to replace the ideal of the Smart City with that of the spectral city - an incomplete city haunted by the ghosts (and composts) of the past.

"2019-09-25 11:20:10",Communication,"Recognizing that Mass Solutions will not work: Seeding and Scaling Small Scale  Communities","We lack a vision for what a 21st century community can look like that truly embraces diversity and difference. Our society is moving towards a homogeneous and tribal kind of world that fears difference. One of the most important court case in the US Brown vs Board of Education (1954) established that separate was not equal when it comes to schooling and ordered schools to be desegregated. The blow back from that decision is still being felt. There was minimal willingness on the part of the white middle class to desegregate the schools. An analogous effort to abolish private schools in the UK similarly went down to defeat. So within the sphere of education we create illusion of choice when the facts are that poor and minority students are not given the tools to compete. One of the reasons for this is that education is seen as a separate field. The proposition is that we need to form nurturing small communities that provide both health care, early childhood education and are dedicated to focusing on humanistic values. We need to build public private ventures that can show the power of integration of health, early childhood and education within volunteer communities that celebrate diversity.  In other words instead of just talking about a new vision we should create real communities that live out their values and beliefs. If they work others will be inspired. What is happening and has happened in the past is that we allow communities to go off and form their own isolated societies that have nothing to do with mainstream society. Classically they live off the grid and no one hears from them again. What I am advocating for is a much larger scale experiment that does not then condemn people to live in some kind of hippie colony where they eke out an existence from the land. We need to give people the opportunity to live in a recognizable society but that provides them with the resources that will make families viable and promote healthy growth. The skeptics will say that will take an increased tax burden. That is not the case. When we add up the costs of the social and health consequences of condemning people to under resourced areas --educational failure, prison and mental and physical health issues --the costs are much higher. So the communities have to be founded in special areas where there is an economically viable set of industries and agriculture that can provide the community members with a healthy life. So they are going to be largely agricultural communities with a smattering of high tech.  They have to be intentional--people must opt in for a healthy life style and be prepared to contribute to the general well being. They will pay an adjusted tax and will in return get them an income that will allow them to afford a decent standard of living. Our future will be seeding these communities and not in generating plans for mass society. Mass society has shown its members can be too easily manipulated and that weaker members exploited.

"2019-09-30 17:15:30",Communication,"Spiritual Materialism: participating in the restoration of the world","As a philosopher of alienation, Marx recognised the ultimate non-dual unity of reality. He recognised the development of 'one science' as a historical necessity and task. We urgently need to take this project forward. Such a project clearly begins with founding social theory on a coherent ontology of reality, namely a consciousness-derived understanding of reality. In my work, I combine Marx's non-dual philosophy of science and his political economy with: a broader intersectional social theoretical framework; Thomas Campbell's 'Theory of Everything'; insights from quantum theory; and the central concept of Kabbalah, 'Tikkun Olam' (the restoration of the world) to elaborate a practical philosophical framework I call 'Spiritual Materialism'. The framework of Spiritual Materialism is composed of five pillars: Consciousness, Spirituality, Science, Society, and Self. The analysis of each pillar takes the form of a journey from critique of its current historical conditions of alienation and fragmentation to an elaboration of the conditions necessary for our journey towards our personal and collective healing and the restoration.||The paper will set out an overview of a book I am currently writing. I will offer a critique of spirituality that either evades or knows not how to speak about society (political economy). I will similarly offer critique of political/social theorists and activists who know not about how, however material the problem may seem (homelessness, ecocide), what we are fundamentally called to do is to repair ourselves through transforming relations. I will then go through the five pillars of Spiritual Materialism. I will then set out in broad terms my work on what I call a 'Quantum Political Economy'. The journey here in terms of Tikkun Olam is from Scarcity (economism) to Abundance, focused particularly on a transformation of time. Next, I will offer a practical use of Spiritual Materialism to set out a pedagogical practice of transformation. Spirituality is central throughout and I will use the work and, dare I say, try to develop the work of Jewish radicals who combined kabbalah/messianism with anarchist/socialist utopianism (Buber, Landauer, Scholem, Bloch, and, Benjamin).||I chose the theme 'Fighting All Oppression' because I will argue that only a non-dualist ontology can enable us to overcome violence and alienation because the first step in an act of violence is an act of objectification, i.e. an act of separation, i.e. an act of dualist separation.",English,Yes,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,Joel,Lazarus,He,joel_lazarus@hotmail.com,"No affiliation","Oxford PhD 2011|Unable to secure academic job/grant|Currently working as PE supply teacher at secondary schools in Bristol",Bristol,UK,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,joel_lazarus@hotmail.com,"Joel Lazarus",,"Firefox 69.0 / OS X",31.53.133.214,541863640,"51.455200195312, -2.5966000556946"
"2019-10-07 14:19:20",Communication,"Building Internationalism in the Balkan Periphery: Unification of the Left against NATO ","The countries from the Western Balkans, a region envisioned in the Brussel's corridors of power, have been objects of intensive international state-building since the end of the Yugoslav wars/conflicts. Its starting premise of the regional endeavor has been TINA principle: i.e. a 'therapy' prescribed in a form of Euro-Atlanticism and alleged Europeanization is not only presented as a secular religion but also as a differentiation ground to silence and marginalize the opposition voices. What used to be Yugoslavia is being transformed into a militarized colony that is supposed to play an important role in the Cold War 2.0. ||Albeit weak, marginalized and slandered, the left forces (i.e. political parties, movements, and individuals) in the Balkans are gaining momentum and making significant moves towards joint opposition to the new Euro-Atlantic authoritarianism. One of the latest examples includes the joint front against the so-called Prespa agreement, which included left forces from both non-NATO (Macedonia and Serbia) and NATO countries (Greece, Turkey, and Croatia). Another form of trans-border cooperation that was recently promoted concerned the 20th anniversary of NATO bombing campaign in (then) the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: it brought together intellectuals and activists from the region to discuss possibilities to create an anti-NATO front on a regional ground. One could hardly expect new utopias to be born in the periphery (the European one, in this case) but we argue that there is still a lot of potentials to re-invent 'Yugoslavia' as a challenge to the false promises of Euro-Atlantic and European integration, which not only remain a pipe-dream but also make things in the region worse rather than better. This presentation aims at elaborating the Left case against both NATO and EU as it is seen from the left-wing movements in the Balkans, including the possible effects on the so-far dominant TINA position. It will be based on the lessons (non)learned from Yugoslav experiences of regional integration, internationalism as an antidote to nationalism as well as the potentials of the non-aligned movement. |",English,No,"Anti-Imperialism in a Tempest-Tossed World",Models,1,Biljana,Vankovska,she/her,bvankovska@gmail.com,"Cyril and Methodius University","Dr. Biljana Vankovska is a full professor of Political Science at the Institute for Security, Defence, and Peace, Faculty of Philosophy, Ss.

"2019-10-13 14:14:17",Communication,"Sheffield Needs A Pay Rise and the Potential for Trade Union Renewal","Following the turn to neoliberalism from 1979 in Britain, trade unions have undergone a marked decline (Bryson and Forth, 2010). Particularly significant in recent decades has been the failure to recruit young people into trade unions to replenish membership numbers (Simms et al, 2018). Unions have attempted to counteract the declining centrality of work and the plethora of barriers thrown up by processes of neoliberalism, rising precarity (Jeffery et al, 2018) and legislative curbs by turning to 'community unionism' (Holgate, 2015a) and a small number of high-profile attempts to 'crack' precarious workplaces and sectors (Mijin Cha et al, 2018). Yet progress remains sporadic and limited. In this context, we explore the potential of a grassroots unionisation campaign (Sheffield Needs A Pay Rise - SNAP) in the the English core city with the highest proportion of workers earning the national miniumum wage (Clarke, 2017).

"2019-10-21 06:56:25",Communication,"21st Century Strategies to Combat Backsliding into Political Extremism","Across the global political landscape, the backbones of modern democracy, free speech and civil rights, are giving way to the curtailments as a result of the rise of crony-capitalism. Right-wing extremism - in the United States, as it is in Brazil, as it is in the Philippines, Hungary, Poland, and elsewhere - has reemerged with leaders who embody what Richard Hofstadter describes as """"the megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect,"""" positioning themselves as the only ones capable of restoring greatness to their countries (1964:38). Opportunists exploit long-festering social conflicts, as well as economic and political crises of the moment to devastating effect. They rise by positioning their supporters as members of a persecuted class whom they alone can protect and then stoking the fears and paranoias of their adherents through a combination of conspiratorial dramas and demonization of the opposition. In such an environment, the fundamental norms upon which democratic societies can exist - political bargaining and compromise - are weakened, sometimes to the point of being irrecoverable (Levtisky & Ziblatt, 2019).|Vigorous interventionist initiatives are necessary. Educational models require overhaul and innovation, while social media platforms must be regulated in a manner that is more in keeping with accepted forms of regulation that democratic societies impose on traditional forms of communication. A critical goal of educational reform should be to intensify efforts to sensitize citizens to their own democratic rights and responsibilities. It should also be to provide critical thinking and analytical skills sufficient to reduce the impact of malicious actors purposefully working to manipulate civic dialogue and policy making through the distribution of false information and images across social media spaces. This, in turn, may diminish the allure and spread of authoritarianism in contemporary cultural configuration.|With a focus devising better ways to foster social cohesion and cooperation, discussion topics can highlight wedges that are exploited to drive people apart. Included would be how and why fake posts and videos frequently target specific audiences and often play upon themes of xenophobia, racism, white supremacy, intolerance of LGBT and other communities. This can help to best define areas where specific educational initiatives might be concentrated.|As a means toward achieving such ends, several models from the developing world will be introduced for discussion and debate. Included will be: 1) Hyperdemocratic participation: How highly representative bodies - consisting of leaders from government and civil service, NGOs, labor unions, industry, academia, grassroots movements, and so on - can be organized, funded, structured, and directed for the express purpose of tackling significant issues; 2) Educational strategies to diminish inequality: Spain's International Education Network (RIE), whose 10 principles can serve as methodologies to instigate debates in industrialized countries about societal """"others,"""" inclusion within the communities. Equally, Education International (EI), the global federation of teachers' trade unions has extensive experience in effective educational programs that combat racism and xenophobia, and encourage gender and socio-economic exclusion, as well as diversity of race, ethnic origin, etc.|	In relation to social media, updates in journals, newspapers can lead governments and public entities to understand the process that led to social media disproportional abuse and measures to inhibit it thereafter. Konrad Niklewicz points out the use of the fake news, echo chambers and social bots to form public opinion and the necessity to regulate modified versions of existing press laws by the creation of a 'notice and correct' procedure that would stop lies from spreading, allowing affected parties, public or private, to protect their rights. (2017:9) On 29th of April, 2019, BBC News (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47135058) publishes an article to highlight a meeting for government intervention on YouTube and Facebook to block inappropriate content that promotes fake news, hate speech or extremism, or posts that could trigger or exacerbate mental health problems.|	The main key to push these transformations is the people. Popular participation and movements need to continue pressing elect right-wing representatives and their cabinet to back down. Even though education has not been enough to keep the youth from believing in the savior to solve their country's social conflicts, it is the healthiest avenue to take. Corporate social media giants will fight back so as not to lose their profits and power.

Through the examination of the history of the 'Casa dei popoli' funded by the Italian Communist party, this intervention will argue that worker's spaces are key sites of utopian potential for they are locations in which the dynamics of capitalist social reproduction can be subverted and, thus, allow for the upending of one capitalism core contradictions, that of the workers freedom to either labour or starve. Funded as cultural centres and gathering places for workers, 'people's houses', have played, a fundamental role in working-class communities as they provide different forms of support to workers and party members traversing moments of crisis or unemployment. Thus, considering these actions, I will speculate on the possible impact that an expansion of these programs of solidarity might have not only in transforming capital-labour relations but also in a general reimagining of the way in which we understand waged-work and the nuclear family. In that sense, this exposition hopes to initiate a discussion in regard to the strategies adopted by radical political parties in an effort to shift their focus from electoral politics to considering these instances of revolution through social reproduction. Finally, this effort is to be framed under Marx conception of utopia as a negative formulation (Larraín: 1983: 124) in the sense that the utopian task should not be focused on formulating blueprints for an ideal future but on conceiving ways of overcoming the practical and material conditions that distance us from that future. In that sense, this presentation looks to propose a way to eliminate capitalist scarcity and, thus, transform capital-labour relations. ||The survival of the capitalist mode of production rests on the condition that workers show up for work. In other words, as Marx himself pointed out, capitalist production is only possible if workers are able to constantly reproduce themselves and, thus, guarantee continuous and increasing surplus-value. With this in mind, Social Reproduction Theory (SRT) argues that capitalist production must be understood as an integrated whole in which process of production and reproduction are both fundamental to the sustainment of the system. Following this idea, Tithi Bhattacharya (2017) argues that class struggle should not be limited to the workplace, to the sphere of production, but that instances or reproduction, fundamental in the creation of higher surplus, are also to be seen as places of class dispute. To support this claim, Bhattacharya points out that, under capitalism, the worker is reproduced in lacking, she is guaranteed the bare minimum needed to survive and thus, the next day, she is not only able but 'free' to sell her workforce. In that sense, it is that continuous lacking which partially guarantees that workers show up for work. Here, following SRT's guide, we return to one of the fundamental contradictions of the capitalist mode of production identified by Marx. For Marx, the free labourer, the worker under capitalism, is free to either sell her labour or free to starve. Thus, in the face of this apparent freedom, we can assume that a change in the conditions of social reproduction would fundamentally eliminate this contradiction. In other words, if starvation is no longer the option, if workers can access the means of reproduction outside of the capitalist mode of production, their 'freedom' is no longer determined by a death sentence. If the market is no longer the sole place in which the worker can obtain everything she needs to survive, then her decision to work or not becomes truly free. No one is forced to show up for work. With this in mind, the question that arises is how can workers provide for themselves outside of the process of capitalist production? What historical examples can provide insight on effective and efficient ways of overturning this reproductive logic of always-already lacking?||During the second half of the XXth century, multiple communist parties throughout Europe established  community centres or popular houses in which workers could assemble. These spaces were never seen as more than compliments to a larger task of class building and political struggle and, as such, were never seen as central in the worker's struggle. In spite of this, popular houses provided workers with possibilities to entertain themselves outside of the factory; to enjoy 'services' otherwise unattainable to the unaffiliated labourer, such as education, physical training or free beer; as well as support and safety in times of unemployment or crises. In that sense and in the unawareness of their radical potential, these  communal spaces, even though crucial in creating class solidarity, intervened directly  in reproductive sphere of capitalist production. They allowed workers to live better lives without ever fully eliminating the fundamental lacking and, thus, contributed to the productive process. But now, aware of their involuntary contribution and taking into consideration the role that the reproductive sphere plays in the whole of capitalist production, it is crucial that we return to these communal spaces and see them as places of radical transformation. These popular houses represent clear examples of communal reproduction outside of the norms of the capitalist mode of production, nuclear family included, and, as such, are clear guidelines towards overcoming the fundamental dynamics of capitalism. By reviewing the particular history of the 'Casa dei popoli' funded by the Italian Communist Party, I intend to highlight certain programs that, if expanded in order to provide for a large portion of the working class, could effectively allow for a transformation of capitalist relations of production and reproduction.|||Bibliography: ||•	Bhattachary, T.

Elle vise une transformation vers une économie à faible émission de carbone tout en répondant aux vulnérabilités générées par ce changement pour les travailleurs, travailleuses, et leur communauté. Le terme est maintenant reconnu, notamment endossé par le Bureau International du Travail (ONU) depuis 2015.

"2019-10-25 10:50:35",Communication,"A Utopia in the Middle East: The Rojava Revolution Invaded","The tidal waves of the Arab Spring swept Syria and triggered a civil war between the regime and its supporters, various factions of dissidents (Free Syrian Army), jihadists, and the Kurds. Amidst this devastating war in Syria, the Rojavans (people of Western Kurdistan) set out to organize themselves in a multiethnic, communalist, social ecologist system without a central authority and beyond the parameters of ethnic nationalism. Following Abdullah Öcalan's Bookchin-inspired theories on social ecology and libertarian municipalism, they have been experimenting on direct democracy, democratic autonomy, and ethno-religious pluralism, and confederalism. Yet, Rojava Revolution is under fire both literally and metaphorically. The YPG (People's Protection Units) and the YPJ (Women's Protection Units) have been fighting against IS (Islamic State) since the beginning of Syrian War. Then there is heavy artillery and now the invasion of their liberated homeland by the Turkish state.  However, the PYD has been defending the cause on many international fronts against foes and skeptics. While critics give credit to the Rojava """"lab"""" that it is indeed innovative, they nevertheless define the Rojavan charter of social contract (2014) 'utopian.' In this paper, I take issue with both colloquial and anti-utopian implications of this position prevalent among anti-Kurdish right and even among some leftist circles in the West. ||Analyzed from the perspective of what Lyman Tower Sargent called 'social dreaming' (1994), the Rojava Revolution, I argue, debunks the elision between 'perfection' and 'impossibility' of Utopia that its critics imply. Echoing previous utopian experiments in Europe such as the Paris Commune in 1871 or the Revolutionary Catalonia in the 1930s, the Revolution in Western Kurdistan has been the contemporary example of what Ernst Bloch once called the utopian impulse - an anthropological and ontological drive for a better world, a human predisposition which is not a sole property of European peoples. Thus, I propose to use the very methods and concepts of utopian studies itself to dissect (critical-) utopian elements of Rojavan experiment by focusing on theoretical texts by Ocalan and Bookchin as well as published accounts on the first-hand experiences of the Rojavans. ||All in all, this paper aims to fulfill a triple purpose: First, it retrieves utopianism embodied in Rojava Revolution which imagines, creates, and theorizes an alternative, radical way of life amidst an incessant war. Furthermore, by utilizing the conceptual and methodological tools of utopian studies, it attempts to shed light on the dreams and nightmares that concern the alternative ways in which the Rojavans have arranged their everyday life without a central authority. Third, going beyond the current, instrumentalizing narratives on the Kurds as """"betrayed allies"""" and as """"historical victims"""" of four nation-states (Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria), this account provides a better, complete understanding of the Rojavan political model as lived experience thereby giving the long-overdue agency to the builders of this real-life Utopia: The Rojava.

In Brazilian visual arts, such criticism is unprecedented in the last fifty years. Strongly boosted by the 1964 civil-military coup, dependency never ceased to be a determinant force in Brazil, even during the praised """"social turning"""", done under the Worker's Party administration.||To this end, Roda Gigante set up an immense and meticulous scenic structure, based on the symptomatic dialectic between order and disorder, in which hundreds of signs of the various and unsuccessful cycles of late and accelerated modernisation were spread over the floor. From there, the objects were tied, through a network of 250 ropes of different colours and thicknesses, to the capitals of the neoclassical columns of a cultural institute headquarter controlled by a multinational financial group. The web laminated and decomposed the view of the monumental hall, leading the visitor to reflect on the links between the failed cycles of fraudulent modernisation and architectural clichés, inherent in the farce of puppet States and dependent oligarchies.||The paper will analyse, based on images, the construction procedures of Roda Gigante. It also aims to situate this work in the Brazilian tradition of anti-art of a tragic tenor. And, as well, to resume the threads of a totalising historical reflection, which had in Hélio Oiticica's Tropicália and Glauber Rocha's Terra em Transe (Entranced Earth), both from 1967, their last emblematic epic moments.||Nevertheless, it is crucial to consider that it is not up to art, yet when carrying an epic and tragic maturity and able to disclose and scrutinise social and historical contradictions, to propose perspectives and transitions.

"2019-10-28 13:46:54",Communication,"Technological Transitions: AI in and Against Work","Are we in the midst of an industrial revolution? The rise of big data, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence has provoked a wave of sensationalist media responses with predictions that robots will take all jobs, algorithms will be our bosses and artificial intelligence will deliver a world beyond work. There are a number of reports and studies that assess the probability that certain tasks will be significantly augmented or displaced during this wave of automation (Deloitte, 2019; McKinsey Global Institute, 2017; World Economic Forum, 2018). Recent surveys find high levels of anxiety about automation and technological change (Zhang and Dafoe, 2019). History has shown that these anxieties are not misplaced - from Engels' Pause (Allen, 2009) to Keynes' """"temporary period of maladjustment"""" (Keynes, 1933) and secular stagnation (Popović Milenko, 2018). ||However, are the current changes qualitatively new or merely a continuation of the digitalisation and computerisation revolution that began in the 1970s? Certain new phenomena such as the """"platform"""" or """"gig"""" economy are new in their surface appearances but conceal very established capital-labour relationships. The displacement or deskilling of labour is also not new. With the introduction of AI, changes are not captured by digitalisation, and robotic process automation resulting in faster and less labour-intensive production. Instead, AI is increasingly able to take on customer-facing, managerial and problem-solving tasks. Some machines can now autonomously find ways to save labour. The scale of the capture of workers' knowledge is quantitatively unprecedented, which through a feedback loop is likely to produce a qualitative shift. This has important social implications, particularly in the context of a more polarised and unequal world. New strata are being created both at the """"top""""- e.g. """"data professionals"""", and at the """"bottom""""- people doing poorly-paid data curation work. What other changes might we see?

The close existence of the two nations in a very small area and their economic co-dependence as well as changes on the ground makes the Bi-National State or the Two State Solutions almost impossible to apply. Also the peace treaties as we know them so far - between Israel and Palestine, Egypt and Jordan - failed to bring tranquility to the region while preserving the existing oppressive sociopolitical and economic order.

Patriarchy has been the breeding ground of these ideologies with nature, women and the global South - their three colonies to occupy, use and exploit, often cruelly and viciously. These proposals do not address the fundamental issue of how the power relations between Israelis and Palestinians or between races, ethnicities and genders may come to an end. As such, they ignore the intersectionality and the interlocking matrix of domination   and fail to imagine an alternative society for all. ||I therefore find the Western paradigm -based on borders, power relations, statism, nationalism, neo-liberalism, racist and sexist ideologies - and the existing proposals problematic at least and worthless at most. Instead, I was inspired by the Gift Economy, by Matriarchal legacy preserved by Native people and by Indigenous Knowledge- especially the concepts of Satyagraha and Ubuntu  as well as by the subsistence perspective that is heavily influenced by the Global South. ||These ways of thinking suggest a new maternal-feminist and indigenous paradigm to critique existing structures and to formulate an alternative value system and socio-political norms: giving, needs and need orientation, linking and connecting, communalism, inclusion of all, respect to Nature.||On this basis, I propose an alternative political order between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, that is, all parts of Greater Israel and Palestine, whose building blocks are - inclusion, local and self-sufficient communities, shared spaces, balance and consensual democracy, reconciliation and earth spirituality.

"2019-10-30 14:41:42",Communication,"The Crisis of Capitalism and the Canadian State","Over the last decade, Canadian capitalism has become increasingly unstable. It is facing, we demonstrate, a classic profitability crisis as described by Marx in Capital. This profitability crisis has led in turn to several related challenges, including economic stagnation and unemployment, a household debt-driven real estate and construction boom, and an increasingly fragile financial system. We argue that in response to this period of volatility, the Canadian state and capital have developed a two-pronged strategy to stabilizing capitalism that entail significant intensification of the settler colonial project and exploitation of labour in order to restore profitability. On the one hand, it is stepping up its drive to expand oil and gas exports from the west coast to Asia. On the other, we are witnessing further austerity measures and the rollback of labour rights and further efforts to disorganize the working class.

Fredric Jameson, a well-known utopian studies scholar and Marxist social theorist, argues that contemporary utopian fiction, for the most part, appears in intervals that are characterized by a sense of tranquillity before a seemingly unpredictable revolutionary upheaval occurs. However, British historian and political essayist Perry Anderson partially rejects this account. He extends the production of utopian fiction to periods that are defined by civil unrest as well.  However, are these hypotheses still relevant in dominance of """"communicative capitalism?"""" These contradicting views fail to give a sufficient explanation relating to the large number of dystopian and anti-utopian, a third and often overlooked category, fiction that is currently being produced. So, this raises a series of important questions: What is their social and political impact? How does utopian, dystopian, and anti-utopian support or oppose social and political transformation? And, finally, why is it important to distinguish these three categories? I believe that Italian political theorist, journalist, and politician Antonio Gramsci provides a much-needed clarification with his concept of hegemony and its function within civil society. My essay examines the relationship between contemporary utopian, dystopian, and anti-utopian fiction, and hegemony. It seeks to understand how these separate categories support or oppose ruling class interests.

RW wanted to take culture, and cultural theory,  seriously, but did not want to do so in isolation from the working-class and social struggle. It aimed to be a site of serious cultural discussion and help rebuild, as much as possible, left-wing artistic practice. This developed into what RW called the """"popular avant-garde"""" approach; a sort of  left-aesthetic-regroupment; seeking aesthetic and conceptual experimentation, in part based on historic practice, combined with a preoccupation with the lives, concerns, psychologies, and subjectivities, of the exploited and oppressed. RW took pains to mine the history of current and past left aesthetic strategies in an ecumenical manner.|That approach, while still important, is now insufficient. Globally, the fascist and far right threat has grown. In the United States socialism has gone from a notional to actual movement. Abstract debates have become increasingly concrete. What is true of politics and struggle in general is true of culture and aesthetics. We cannot pretend, as some do, to be agnostic on questions of design, cybernetics, the white cube, realism vs. irrealism, etc. It does not follow that debates on these questions need to be overly polemicized. However, the specificity of socialist-aesthetic strategy has become more important. This does not entail opposition to artistic freedom and autonomy, however partial and contingent it may be under capitalism. Nor does it mean a denigration of  speculative practice. It does mean that the question of practice has become more important; and we need to begin to discuss our goals and desired outcomes in a comradely manner. Some current and former editors of RW have started a parallel project to RW, Locust Review, which specifically argues for a critical irrealist aesthetic and conceptual approach. Other editors are working on other projects and areas of research.|RW and LR have jointly organized this two-part panel, """"Towards a Socialist Aesthetic and Cultural Strategy,"""" to explore the demands of this moment.||This is the first of two parts|",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Strategies,3,Adam,Turl,adam.turl@unlv.edu,"The Case for Critical Irrealism","Against its slow cancelation, how does one imagine a future? In the imploding temporalities of new authoritarianism and climate collapse, is there something, some small fragment of rubble, that can point the way toward an emancipatory way of life? Is there room for a new totality to be imagined even as reality repeatedly undermines itself?||All of these questions are borne of a present and deepening crisis in capitalist realism. The impact this crisis has had on working-class people's subjectivity has been profound: their sense of time, of place, of being and becoming. While aesthetic and cultural approaches of the past four decades have feebly accepted, either explicitly or implicitly, the cynicism of No Alternative, there nonetheless persists an impulse of future poetry that must be fully unearthed. One that is loyal less to empirical reality than truthful futurity, less to """"realism"""" than to the irreal.||As Michael Lowy has argued, there is a strong lineage of this critical irrealism running through the aesthetic approaches of radical movements. One that hews closely to both libertarian communism and dissident Marxism; from Kafka to surrealism, from the Brecht-Lukacs debates to situationism and its myriad offshoots of the radical geographic imagination. ||What's more, the outlook of today's working class is by default irrealist, as evidenced by the popularity of the """"New Weird"""" in literature, film, and music -- including outwardly communist recent works such as Boots Riley's Sorry to Bother You.

This strategy, however, remained implicit, and it is only retroactively conceivable in a configurational sense. What occurred was what I have called a """"Missed Encounter"""", in which the organized forces of the Left and the (dis)organized forces of film and music scenes failed to come to terms with one another even when they lived under the same roof. There is a possibility, now, however, for a consummated encounter, but the opposite possibility exists as well.||2020 finds us, for the first time since the sixties, with a growing new socialist movement, one with far more sobriety than the New Left, perhaps even too much sobriety. While the New Left had a perhaps naïve, perhaps adventurist faith that the revolution was around the corner, significant currents of socialists today have explicitly embraced a gradualist approach to the socialist project. By contrast, the best cultural production appeals to an emergent popular subjectivity that explicitly embraces social transformation. The implications of many popular cultural artifacts is as far ahead of the visions of many of today's socialists as the self-criticality and sense of foreboding underlying some late sixties/early seventies film and music was to the New Left.  In both epochs of ferment, cultural producers, however uneven, were and are synoptic, with a better handle on the terrain upon which they operated than many of their contemporaneous chroniclers, theorists or cadre. ||The poet Robert Hunter points out that a storyteller's job is to """"shed light, not to master"""". Thus what the maligned sophists were able to crystallize about ancient Athens shone light that would later be mastered by what has become known as """"philosophy"""", a process that itself has perhaps been superseded by Marxist theory. Marxist mastery is making manifest of what is already there. If the workers' movement is overly cautious yet cultural producers are moving increasingly towards an art that indeed has revolutionary implications, the role of the critic must be to get the working class vanguard stoned. And in getting this vanguard stoned, cultural production will benefit from continued organic connection to the workers' movement, one that will become increasingly vital as the hour gets late.|",English,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Strategies,1,Jordy,Cummings,he/him,jordycummings@gmail.com,"Red Wedge","Jordy Cummings is a cultural critic, educator and side-hustler based in Toronto.

Not only because he articulated the predominance of the male gaze and discussions of power, but because he referenced Walter Benjamin's Art in the Mechanical Age. Namely that, through reproduction, when art is removed from its intended location of contact with the public, it takes on different meanings through recontextualization, -- the intrinsic location of artwork lending some of the meaning overall (part of the psychological pilgrimage to approaching art). And today, because of the internet, images that were once only seen in situ or even in hard-copy reproductions are now potentially more ubiquitous -- visual art is not only reproduceable, it is portable -- on the internet, on screens, in your pocket, in your hands: the in situ is you. Looming large and adding to this are issues of surveillance, that go hand in hand with the internet, so that you have a recipe for a very different set of circumstances than what Berger had in mind when he wrote his famous book.

Not only does the individual working-class subject represent a variety of categorical identities and oppressions, each individual worker creates, both in everyday life and their conscious and subconscious processing of that life, a creative-social-psychological universe building (a conscious and subconscious narrative of their life). Within this alterity the subject negotiates their own uniqueness, actuality, existential mortality, desire for a valued life, with the dominant culture of capitalist exploitation and oppression. If each gravedigger of capitalism creates their own universe, the working-class as a whole creates, in terms of culture and the social subconscious, a multiverse of gravediggers.  A working-class cultural opposition to capitalism, therefore, will, in some manner, represent this multiverse. |Beginning in 2019, the presenter and their collaborator, Tish Markley, have been working on two ongoing projects whose aim is, in some regard, to begin to show the unshowable, the gravedigger's multiverse. The first project, Born Again Labor Museum (BALM), aims to be """"an evolving installation and performance of working-class dream-life."""" The title of the work intentionally conflates the Marxist schematic of living and dead labor with evangelical Christian language. This was inspired, in part, by Michael Löwy's reading of Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project and """"Theses on History"""" in Fire Alarm, in particular what Löwy sees as Benjamin's appropriation into Marxism of the theological concept of apocatastasis -- the redemption of all past souls. In the Benjaminian usage he refers to how the messianic generation -- the generation that makes the revolution -- redeems all previous and lost generations of the exploited and oppressed. This is translated into the art space by a kind of modular muralism; in which multiple images, stories, and narratives, are grouped and de-grouped in various ways. |The second project, Locust Review, a collaboration that also includes the philosopher, Holly Lewis, the writer and journalist, Alexander Billet, and author and poet, Michael Linaweaever, aims to create a space and platform for contemporary critical irrealist socialist writing.

Even as mainstream popular culture and arts organizations increasingly toy with left-wing themes and the public becomes more open to socialist ideas, activist culture has not wholly engaged with the liberatory potential of the arts.||The reactionary far-right, even while it derides the role of arts, has managed to harness the momentum of pop culture, from co-opting the symbols of comics, film, and television, to low-brow and low-budget harnessing of memes to transmit its ideology, to organize, and to influence mainstream political discourse. While it may be tempting to be dismissive of these strategies, they are not dissimilar to the graphic, populist aesthetic of early Soviet art or the deconstructionist critique of Dadaism, and they parallel the means through which the aesthetic is used to disseminate political ideas. ||We are now in a unique moment where an emergent socialist movement has the potential to gain popular traction.

"2019-11-04 20:11:10",Communication,"Transcending the Law of Value and the State: a Central Dilemma in Post-Marx Marxism","One of the reasons for the profound crisis affecting the radical left is the difficulty of articulating what is needed to break from and transcend the capitalist law of value, on the one hand, and lack of clarify concerning the role of the state in the transition to socialism and in socialism itself. Although the law of value, as an economic formation, and the state, as a political one, may seem to be separate issues, this paper will explore why the transcendence of one involves the transcendence of the other. I will seek to demonstrate this through a close re-reading of Marx's late writings on the state and value production. The recent issuance of a new translation of Marx's 'Critique of the Gotha Program', in which this writer was involved, shows that previous translations into English (and other languages) conflated Marx's discussion of """"the state"""" (der Staat) with """"state functions"""" (Staatwesen)-leading a set of problematic assumptions about post-capitalist society that continue to define many of today's debates. I will also show that Marx's discussion of """"an exchange of equal values"""" as defining the initial phase of a post-capitalist society is consistent with his view that value production is specific to capitalism and capitalism alone.",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Models,1,Peter,Hudis,He/Him,phudis@oakton.edu,"Professor of Humanities and Philosophy, Oakton Community College","Peter Hudis is a Professor of Humanities and Philosophy at Oakton Community College and author of 'Marx's Concept of the Alternative to Capitalism (Brill, 2012) and 'Frantz Fanon: Philosopher of the Barricades' (Pluto Press, 2015), and has published in nume'rous journals on issued related to International Politics, Latin American Social Movements, Critical Race Theory, and Contemporary Political and Social Philosophy.

"2019-11-06 08:39:18",Communication,"The fight against Uber: class composition and transnational organising","Uber now has around 3 million drivers across the world. This would make it the largest global employer - if it did not use bogus self-employment to engage its workers. Drivers have formed networks, associations, and unions in some countries, organising protests and strikes against the platform. In the run up to Uber's IPO in 2019 these became coordinated across national borders. Little is known so far about the new subjectivities that are forming between Uber drivers on a transnational level. However, as I have argued with Callum Cant, 'we need to stop talking about resistance as emerging in platform work', instead beginning to focus on the new class composition that is emerging and understanding what forms of struggle can be successful. This paper draws on an ongoing workers inquiry with Uber drivers, both in the UK and with the first international drivers convening that brought drivers together from across the world. Using the threefold framework of class composition developed by Notes from Below, this paper explores the technical (the organisation of platform work by Uber), the social (the organisation of drivers within class society), and the new political (forms of resistance and struggle) composition taking place with Uber drivers.

"2019-11-08 03:17:36",Communication,"Depoliticizing growth, space and infrastructure: Metabolic rifts in the constitution of the Finnish knowledge-based economy","Rapidly accelerating climate breakdown and crises of neoliberalism have repoliticized the terrain of business-as-usual capitalism. Regarding the destruction of planetary ecology, fossil-fuel powered heavy industry has rightly been recognized as the main antagonist. However, the perceived antidotes of greenwashed network and service economies are built on globally and locally uneven arrangements of carbon-intensive extraction and infrastructure.||In this paper I argue that the function of contemporary political imaginaries of knowledge-intensive capitalism is to obfuscate the relationships between economic growth, natural resources and infrastructure. This process of dematerialization severs the connections of 'flows' and 'hubs' of economic activities from their energetic base. The ontological uprooting of matter operates as a necessary condition for the realization of economically fashionable 'decoupling' and 'green growth'. The crucial omission is the globally networked carbon-intensive infrastructure that sustains technologically advanced economies. ||Knowledge-intensive capitalism accelerates two key contradictions: 1.)

"2019-11-08 10:20:53",Communication,"Dispossessing Bodies: Fighting Violence beyond Possessive Individualism ","Sexualized and gender violence is a common feature of everyday life for most people across the globe. Regimes of femicides are alive and breathing. Domestic violence is a cruel harbinger for mass shootings; incels rage and kill, supposedly """"robbed of what is rightfully theirs"""": |(feminised) bodies for sex.  And yet, avoiding a deeper analysis of the origins of the epidemic, the commonly proposed antidotes remain reductive and ultimately not only unhelpful but harmful: seeking individual responsibility and blame, securitization, heightened punishment and citizenship regulations, and a retreat into the private sphere, to name a few. Starting with this, the initial intuition of this paper is that struggles against violence need to strike at what I call """"cultures of property"""", i.e. both the material and structural logic of property and its embodied twin possessiveness. Therefore, the argumentative structure is threefold.||Firstly, it analyses the blight of a system and its subjects built on ownership. Property relations of """"western modernity"""", i.e. colonial capitalism, have worked to produce proprietarian and acquisitive subjects along class lines and racial and gender markers. Legalized and internalized entitlement over other people's bodies has made violence, particularly sexualized violence, appear legitimate. This is not a thing of the past: today we witness ongoing logics of dispossession of land and bodies. Across society, possessive sentiment pervades social relations and does not stop short of interpersonal relationships. The desire to own, appropriate and accumulate is inscribed into bodies. Such systems of ownerships impair supportive social relations and exude a violence that clearly extends into the realm of gender relations and sexuality. ||Secondly, it points to the pitfalls of strategies against violence that collapse into the same proprietarian logic; focusing on the common emancipatory declaration of self-ownership. Slogans around self-ownership are prevalent particularly in movements against gender oppression, such as """"my body my choice"""" (pro-choice and anti-slutshaming campaigns), """"repossessing my body"""" (empowering statement after sexual assault), or """"born like this"""" (LGBTIQ* movements posing sexuality or gender as bodily property). These fierce slogans can be vital to reject foreign control and build individual and collective self-confidence. Yet, self-ownership is the basis for (liberal) theories of acquisition such as Locke's and paves the way for the kind of possessive individualism critiqued in the first place. While supposed to free the body and enable a re-thinking of social and intimate relations, self-ownership objectifies, abstracts and commodifies it.||Finally, it poses alternative views of subjectivity, embodiment and relationality beyond individualistic appropriation. If property structures sexualized violence through social relations of gender, race and along class, or ownership, lines then we need to find depropriated forms of relating. Self-possession should not - nor can it - accurately describe the reality of bodies in the world. What is needed is a transformation of the relationship between having and being, currently so hard to think separately. The view of the body as vulnerable, relational and interdependent has recently (re-)gained traction. There is potential in collective activism attacking material property relations while shedding possessive practices, as well as in politics of queerness troubling traditional matrices of ownership and dispossession by positing alternative kinds of kinship and desire.|",English,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Strategies,1,"Hannah ",Voegele,she/her,hannahvoegele@web.de,"FU Berlin, HU Berlin, University of Potsdam",,,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hannahvoegele@web.de,"Hannah Voegele",,"Safari 12.1.2 / OS X",195.195.176.212,553724542,"51.600399017334, -0.19400000572205"
"2019-11-08 11:56:21",Communication,"Workers' Self-Management in Argentina Contesting Neo-liberalism by Occupying Companies, Creating Cooperatives, and Recuperating Autogestión","This paper is an overview of the key findings from my new book, Workers' Self-Management in Argentina: Contesting Neo-liberalism by Occupying Companies, Creating Cooperatives, and Recuperating Autogestión (Historical Materialism Book Series, vol. 199). In the book, I home in on the emergence and consolidation of Argentina's empresas recuperadas por sus trabajadores (ERTs, worker-recuperated enterprises), a workers' occupy and recuperation movement that surged at the turn of the millennium in the thick of the country's neo-liberal crisis. Since then, around 400 companies have been taken over and converted to cooperatives by almost 16,000 workers. Grounded in class-struggle Marxism, political economy, labour process theory, and a critical sociology of work, the book situates the ERT movement in Argentina's long tradition of working-class activism and the broader history of workers' responses to capitalist crisis. Beginning with the voices of the movement's protagonists, the book ultimately develops a social theory of autogestión-a politically prefigurative and ethically infused notion of workers' self-management that unleashes radical social change for work organizations, surrounding communities, and beyond.||Argentina's ERTs began to emerge as workers' bottom-up responses to the collapse of the country's neoliberal model during the years spanning the turn of the millennium. As business bankruptcies and unemployment rates soared to unprecedented levels during these years, more and more workers in a broad cross-section of Argentina's urban-based economy began to takeover and self-manage capitalist workplaces in crisis that had formerly employed them, reconstituting them as worker cooperatives. And they continue to emerge in response to a new wave of anti-labour legislation, business closures, unemployment and precarity, and myriad other socio-economic challenges unleashed since early-2016 by the administration of Mauricio Macri (Ruggeri, 2016; Ruggeri & Vieta, 2015; Vieta, 2018). As a rejoinder to these challenges, ERTs have been practicing forms of autogestión (self-management) that both contest the neoliberal enclosures of life while prefiguring other, more directly-democratic and less exploitative economic arrangements grounded in redesigned labour processes and community-centred development. Argentina's ERTs have thus proven to be viable alternatives by workers themselves to macro- and micro-economic crises, anti-labour policies, and the worst effects of the neoliberal model on working people, inspiring other worker self-management projects in other parts of the world (Atzeni & Vieta, 2014; Vieta, Depedri, & Carrano, 2017; Vieta, 2018). ||This paper summarizes research I have been conducting over the past decade with Argentina's ERTs (Vieta, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2018), and that is now published as a book in Brill's """"Historical Materialism"""" series (Vieta, 2020). The paper assesses: (1) the political economic conditions and historical labour struggles out of which ERTs emerge; (2) their worker-protagonists' struggles to re-appropriate once privately owned capitalist firms, reconstruct them as worker cooperatives, and thereby democratize the labour process; and (3) how ERT workers transform themselves (from managed employees to self-managed workers), their workplaces (from hierarchical organizations to democratically run worker cooperatives), and communities (from depleted neighbourhoods to self-provisioning localities). ||The book deploys two complementary research approaches: a """"political economy of the working class"""" stream rooted in class-struggle Marxist theory (Lebowitz, 2003; Marx, 1864/1978; McNally, 1993), and an extended case study stream (Burawoy, 1999). Extensive ethnographic observations in three illustrative ERT case studies and observations in numerous other ERTs are complemented by semi-structured interviews with 60 ERT protagonists and Argentine labour leaders and policy makers. Guiding the analysis are the conceptual tools offered by labour process theory (Atzeni, 2010; Burawoy, 1985; Marx, 1867/1867) and social movement learning approaches (Foley, 1999; Hall & Clover, 2005; Livingstone & Roth, 2001; Overwein, 2000; Schugurensky, 2000). The interviews include a series of embedded learning indicators that specifically gauge for changes in worker-members' subjectivities from having participated in workplace takeovers and the subsequent dynamics of self-managed labour processes that emerge in their new worker cooperatives. The book's findings detail how ERT workers: (1) acquire new job skills, learn new cooperative and collective values and practices, and personally and collectively transform from being involved in the ERT; (2) democratize the labour process of once-capitalist firms; (3) incorporate egalitarian pay schemes and job sharing strategies; and (4) recuperate the social production of wealth by opening up shops to the community and engaging in community social and economic development """"from below."""" ||The book concludes that Argentina's ERTs are promising and prefigurative alternative work organizations that sketch out how new worker subjectivities and workplaces can be created from out the shell of former capitalist workplaces. ERTs, in short, delineate suggestive proposals for how workers themselves can-and do-re-conceptualize new forms of work organizations and community-focused social relations of production rooted in solidarity, collaborative information and resource exchange, and mutual aid rather than individualism, commodification, and competition.|",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Models,1,Marcelo,Vieta,He/him,marcelo.vieta@utoronto.ca,"Program in Adult Education and Community Development, University of Toronto","Marcelo Vieta is Assistant Professor in the Program in Adult Education and Community Development and the Collaborative Program in Workplace Learning and Social Change at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto (OISE/UT).

Why does Marx describe Capital as a study of 'natural history', and how might this claim contribute to our debates surrounding the concept of the """"Anthropocene"""" today? Marx's confrontation with Darwin's theory of evolution, I argue, led him to grasp the emergence and consolidation of capitalist social relations as an event of natural history. Although Marx affirms Darwin's theory (in which he recognized radical implications), in Capital he criticizes the way that bourgeois social relations obscure their having being formed as a natural-historical process. In Marx's approach, the distinction between nature and society is at once affirmed and cancelled out: affirmed because capitalism is shown to be but a form adopted by one species; cancelled out because the very adoption of this form is social and set against nature itself. Today, in the face of our planet's ecological emergency, Marx's approach is essential. We are likely to see a re-formation, and transformation of the human life of the planet (and its management).

That is, the fact that women are relegated to undervalued, often difficult work that is performed outside the realm of capitalist production is identified as the socio-material basis of their oppression. The concept of labour, in this perspective, is understood as a discrete set of tasks that are variably - and unfairly - valued. Social reproduction feminism treats labour as something more than that. It holds that women's oppression rests on not gendered labour per se, but on the essential-but-contradictory interaction between paid and unpaid labour (including differently valued forms of care work). This theory is grounded in an expansive and more elemental understanding of labour. It invokes the understanding that Marx describes in the Economic Manuscripts of labour as practical human activity. As a result, social reproduction feminism invites us to think more critically about that which is often taken for granted (in society and in Marxist theory): that there is a relatively clear division between the concepts of work and play. And in so doing, it prompts crucial questions for socialists about what it might take to create a society in which work is an expression of freedom, not oppression.  |",English,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,Sue,Ferguson,,sueferguson@sympatico.ca,"Wilfired Laurier University",,,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social Reproduction in and from the South","Social reproduction theory has, in recent years, made great strides toward incorporating anti-racist and anti-colonial critique into its tradition.

However, much contemporary social reproduction theory is still focused on how capitalism is reproduced in the Global North. This paper looks beyond the role of migrant women of color, calling for deeper theoretical and empirical work on social reproduction in and from the Global South.

In addition to providing an analytic framework to appreciate the reproduction and central role of labor powers, Social Reproduction Theory (SRT) also has the resources to condemn capitalist social organizations. Since powers for activity can be enjoined and developed in many different ways, SRT has the conceptual resources to criticize relations that form such powers in ways that harm rather than promote human flourishing. SRT invites us to see how activity of reproducing labor-powers in capitalist societies is formed by, and itself forms labor-powers limited in gendered, racialized and other needlessly constraining ways. In this way, SRT shows how capital's self-valorization has at its foundation a narrowing of the field of potentials, and instead values freer activities of life-making. On the basis of Marx's expansive notion of labor-powers as historically developing sets of brains, nerves, and muscles, we develop a wealth of needs and strategies for need-satisfying activity that can be valued over and against their constraint in the self-valorization of capital. In short, SRT's normative commitment to the diverse potentialities of making and actualizing labor-powers permits it to pass judgment on social relations through which capital rather than labor is empowered.|",English,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,Aaron,Jaffe,,aarond.jaffe@gmail.com,"The Juilliard School",,,,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dispossession and the Social Reproduction of Sexualities","|""""Sexuality"""" in the modern sense has been constructed historically from above and below as members of the working class struggled to socially reproduce themselves in conditions of dispossession.

In conceptual terms, it allows thinking about the experience of sharing in opposition to the forms of life or production based on private property.

"2019-11-10 17:34:27",Communication,"Humanism and the Problem of Fascism in the Writings of M.N. Roy ","This paper engages M.N. Roy's efforts to theorize fascism in his 1938 book """"Fascism: Its Philosophy, Professions, and Practices"""". Like other Marxists of his time, Roy understood the rise of fascism as a reactionary effort to save capitalism. However, he also argued that fascism represented a spiritualist political philosophy capable of taking hold in diverse contexts, rather than a uniquely European phenomenon. In particular, Roy was deeply concerned with the possibility of fascism taking hold on some of his compatriots involved with the Indian national movement. As opposed to other contemporaneous thinkers, such the Frankfurt School theorists, or Aimé Césaire, who argued (in quite different registers) that fascism was immanent to the development of Western humanism, Roy understood fascism as a reaction against this tradition. In later work, Roy would come to champion a """"New Humanism."""" This paper reads Roy's humanist writings as a response to the problem of fascism as explored in his earlier work. In so doing, I bring Roy into conversation with recent efforts to revive a Fanonian New Humanism, as in the work of theorists such as Ato Sekyi-Otu, Paul Gilroy, and Sylvia Wynter. By investigating points of tension and common ground in these accounts, the paper sets out to assess to what extent a renewed attention to Roy's work might contribute to an internationalist, anti-colonial, and anti-fascist humanism in the present. |",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,Christopher,Balcom,He/Him,cdbalcom@gmail.com,"York University ","Christopher Balcom is a doctoral student in Social and Political Thought at York University.

"2019-11-10 20:30:37",Communication,"From 'Primitive' Societies to the Phalanstery to the Paris Commune:  Re-Thinking Institutions and the Possibility of Radical Politics","The political efficacy of radical democracy and utopia have long been drawn into question.  Radical democracy is said to ignore the size and complexity of contemporary societies, thus failing to posit practical institutions to replace liberal democratic ones. Utopia is deemed impossible due to the sheer complexity of its implementation. Moreover, the implementation is seen as a threat to the values of an """"open society,"""" instead threatening to transform any such project into a totalitarian nightmare. Taking inspiration from Miguel Abensour's demand to recuperate the efficacy of both democracy and utopia by democratizing utopia and utopianizing democracy, this paper explores|an alternative history of radical political institutions, suggesting the possibilities of popular power outside of the dominant liberal democratic principles of sovereignty and the state. In particular, the paper explores so-called """"primitive"""" societies, the Fourierist phalanstery and the Paris Commune as offering alternative political possibilities. Often dismissed as """"pre-political,"""" """"primitive"""" societies exhibit a complex form of political organization that neutralizes the dynamics of the command-obedience relationship in reconstructing a form of non-sovereign power with egalitarian purposes. Fourier's concept of the phalanstery attempts to conceptualize political institutions capable of combining the passion for solidarity with the necessity of accepting non-hierarchical division as a necessary feature of political life. The Paris Commune shows an attempt at the modern institutionalization of non-sovereign power embracing difference as a condition of possibility of politics, particular in its attempt to block the emergence of a state politics.  Finally, the paper considers how such experiences of radical politics might helps us to think the democratic-utopian possibilities contained in our present political moment. |",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Models,1,Paul,Mazzocchi,He/him,pamazzoc@yorku.ca,"Adjunct Professor, York University",,Toronto,Canada,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pamazzoc@yorku.ca,"Paul Mazzocchi",,"Firefox 70.0 / Windows",72.141.165.232,554335506,"43.665599822998, -79.383003234863"

It does this  through an examination of the activism of the New Tendency in the 1970s in 'Canada,' the Struggle Against Work Collective in Toronto in the 1970s, the publication Zerowork in the 1970s, and the Wages for Housework perspective in the 1970s which was a struggle against unwaged reproductive work.

These official declarations and celebrations are buttressed by the emergence of the neoliberal queer and its racialized class politics of the end goal being acceptance into the white middle class. But this has not been an inevitable long march towards the neoliberal queer since there have been important moments of resistance to and contestation over the emergence of this neoliberal queer racialized class strata. This strata is invested in actively separating LGBTQ2S+ struggles from class, anti-racist, anti-colonial, anti-poverty, feminist and other struggles or else they use a version of 'intersectionality' which becomes a neoliberal strategy of governance of oppressed peoples.

"2019-11-11 05:56:25",Communication,"Political Stupidity: Why are we still not thinking politics?","This project proposes to challenge this account that the current challenges to democracy are disruptions of it natural development. This assumption masked a deeper repressive and undemocratic tendency inherent in political philosophy that remains unresolved in contemporary theories: the assumption that the polis is the public realm of intelligence where those capable of making decisions grounded on reason are free while the idios is the private realm of those lacking the capacity to participate.||The notion of politics is tainted by the undemocratic possibility it tries to disengage itself from due to the constitutive assumption that government is the government of the intelligent over the stupid: the administration of that which corrupts by that which preserves towards the constitution of integrality. More specifically, considering intelligence is equivalent to economic thought, economic expertise guarantees legitimate power against democratic will. Power resulting from 'proper' economic intelligence, i.e., grounded on technics and social management, is always legitimate. In other words, the demos is challenged as the principle of the democratic ethos itself. It becomes contingent or even an impeding factor for the proper implementation of societal rationality, i.e., to the proper management of society.||The hypothesis guiding my analysis is that the alleged crisis of politics is not an extraordinary challenge by undemocratic elements but, instead, expressive of the crisis-prone structure centred around the relationship between technocracy, in its capitalist permutation, and democracy. Even if it comforting to think of those phenomena as exterior attacks exploiting democracies vulnerabilities, I would like to argue instead that they are, in fact, direct consequences of politics theory's own technocratic conditions since political reason is grounded on a capitalist principle of efficient production and profit: on a specific conception of managerial intelligence. Moreover, I will argue that this problematic conception of politics is present in what presented itself as an alternative to the contemporary model.||My project aims at providing a conceptual framework for understanding this relation between intelligence, stupidity and power. The enlightened solution of better educating and informing to oppose the degeneration of politics is not enough. It assumes people do not know better rather than recognizing stupidity as inherit to the. It puts its faith in the emancipatory power of knowledge where in fact it its oppressive and technocratic implications that create the problem in the first place. It once again assumes that if one controls the degeneration (stupidity), harmony would be established. It aims at controlling rather than confronting the issue of stupidity in politics, because it does not treat it as a constitutive feature of democratic politics. One of the central concepts in the Bolsonaro1 campaign was 'the good citizen', in the sense that the obedient citizen has nothing to fear. In other words, the intelligent and reasonable citizen has nothing to fear, only the idiots and criminals are in danger and, moreover, they should be since they are not proper members of the polis.",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Models,1,Yonathan,Listik,He/him,yl18758@essex.ac.uk,"University of Essex","Originally from Brazil.

"2019-11-11 06:17:30",Communication,"Reimagining Environmental Justice from a Fourth World Paradigm","International Environmental Law [IEL] though hailed for its progressive categorization of 'soft' law to enable a flexible procedure to realize environmental consciousness has often been overlooked to safeguard the Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources [PSNR] for nation states in deciding tradeoffs that facilitate economic development over ecosystem protection. Its inability to move beyond the North-South divide, especially displaying the latter as a reluctant actor in environmental negotiations and blamed for raising its poverty agenda for perverting diplomacy, obfuscates the lack of environmental consciousness in the North and ignores the progress of third world communities striving for environmental justice through their social movements. It is imperative to question the fairness within IEL instruments that have sought to embolden the eminent domain principle for state control of resources and diminished the idea of inter-generational equity for indigenous peoples.|||The rapid destruction of global commons pursued using state sovereignty through the terra nullius doctrine seeks to wrest control to the transnationalist capitalist class, which engages in resource accumulation without providing equitable and justiciable remedies to nature and the marginalized communities residing within. Rooted in materialism and extractivism, IEL thereafter seeks to rely upon markets as a remedy for widespread environmental degradation by homogenizing categories which commodify nature that suit the homo economicus and seek to challenge and civilize indigenity for its multiple contestestations of nature. Take for instance, the REDD Plus mechanism under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] which seeks to build an artificial commonality around trees as a carbon sequestering resource by diminishing a community's conception of a forest as an ecosystem. Similarly, the Access and Benefit Sharing [ABS] mechanism under the Nagoya protocol also co-opts traditional knowledge using the 'prior informed consent' clause to universalize their indigenous practices and ways of life as a singular intellectual property to be utilized as a resource. Building on Samir Amin's thesis, such mechanisms promote an unequal ecological exchange by disciplining inclusion of indigenous communities through tacit consent by assimilating them as marginal stakeholders in the discourse of development.|||Although the paradigm of environmental justice began in the backdrop of documenting the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards affecting the conditions of social equity faced by poor, minorities and native inhabitants as their sites faced the brunt the 'locally unwanted land use' and their lack of decision making capacity towards such action, it soon got subsumed within the paradigm of universal human rights. However, this framework has privileged the application of civil and political rights over socio economic rights from an individualistic lens rather than enabling collective recognition and diversity advanced by social movements seeking environmental justice as seen in Narmada Bachao Andolan case. Anthropocentrism has usually dominated human rights approaches and may thus universalise the northern developmental model based on domination of nature and separation of humans from its corpus while treating it in purely instrumental terms. Furthermore, the consequentialist frame adopted by courts in Public Interest Litigation makes it realise justice as per outcomes rather than means, often resulting in a path dependency which favours economic development over the public good conceptualisation of environment protection. The Godavarman and Wildlife First cases presently being heard in the Supreme Court of India are examples where judicial adventurism towards determination of a forest and its legitimate inhabitants has spiralled into a bureaucratic process of interpretation and non-reflexive process of exerting its own governmentality, rather than safeguarding further environmental harm.|||In order to facilitate conditions of socio-economic justice that challenge mainstream accounts of environmentalism through recognition and participation of indigenous peoples, it is critical to move beyond indigenous victories in human rights courts towards facilitating a transformative articulation of their autonomy, politics and ways of living for eliminating their vulnerability. The Niyamgiri referendum by the Dongria Kondh community is an example wherein their unique cultural relations which value stewardship and native epistemologies of care for natural resources was articulated as means for achieving social justice, equal rights and survival of distinctive cultural heritage, thus making a case for the indigenous right to environmental self determination on the basis of territorial sovereignty over their ancestral lands. The characterization of these movements through direct action and civil disobedience, despite rampant suppression and displacement, seeks to challenge the structural violence of the law through its word, as interpreted by courts and applied by the state machinery.|||Building from UNDRIP's recognition of economic sovereignty and right to self determination, the Fourth World perspective offers a paradigm shift towards viewing nature and facilitating environmental justice for indigenous communities. By moving beyond the ethnocentric bias of state sovereignty, it envisions a strategy of resistance to the dominant idea of nature constructed by the modern globalized states promoting neo-liberal eco-efficiency instruments against environmental harm with a more culturally syncretic form of natural economy of inter-human and cross-species relationships to facilitate an environmental justice. Rather than collapsing resistance into a co-optive exercise with the human rights discourse taking center stage in negotiating the dissatisfaction of environmental justice and legal claims of indigenous social movements, it calls for imbibing an indigenous legal tradition that speak to external relations, such as those between nations, to the land, animals and outsiders that create alternative histories and repurpose the mainstream international law and Third World project.|||Thus, this piece seeks to develop a conception of environmental justice by fulfilling the capability of the subaltern tribals in a post-colonial state, to exert autonomy over their local natural resources, without falling prey to the greed of the sovereign agenda of promoting a homogenized idea of development. By making the indigenous person a political actor with active personality to enable his/her assertion, this paradigm espouses the need for gathering legitimacy for grassroot struggles of environmental justice within the discourse of legal pluralism by challenging mainstream law-making categories. The paper will elaborate upon the same through four parts: first, highlighting the failure of IEL by promoting green governmentality under the UNFCCC agenda to build an artificial commonality for nature; second, the inability of rights based approaches to encompass the substantive claims of social movements; third, to propose the fourth world approach as a paradigm for recognising resistance of indigenous peoples and foster autonomous self determination for natural resources within a glocal framework; and last, to engender decolonial paradigms towards fostering capabilities of indigenous peoples in their struggle for environmental justice.||",English,No,"Decolonizing Knowledge",Strategies,1,Pranav,Menon,He,pranavmenon19@gmail.com,"M Phil Centre for Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University","I am a part time environmental lawyer and activist.

"2019-11-11 07:26:03",Communication,"Transnational Communist Networks in the Post-WWI Middle East: Anti-colonialism, internationalism and itinerant militancy","My research focuses on a thoroughly transnational subject, which provides us with a more-than-needed glance to the dynamics of a region where borders, identities and politics were in a process of drastic change and reshaping after the Great War. I study the transnational networks created by militants of numerous nationalities, religions and political backgrounds, creating an alternative form of anti-colonialism in the Middle-Eastern metropolises, using them as """"communist hubs"""".||The bulk of my research could be summed up in two main parts. First, I am trying to reconstruct the above-mentioned networks, more often than not forgotten, falling from the cracks of the teleological national history writing. These networks take the shape of those formed by Turkish, Greek, Romanian, Bulgarian, Russian and French communists in the occupied Istanbul between 1920 and 1923, or these created by Italian ex-anarchists, ex-Wafdist Sunni Arabs and ex-Zionist Jewish militants in Alexandria in the first half of the '20s.  Following the paper trail left behind by these transnational Cominternian networks and tracking their role in the anti-colonial struggles of the Post-War Middle East allows us to rethink the narrative of anti-colonial struggles as one shaped along the strict lines of national and religious identities.||Secondly, I try to avoid limiting my research to the boundaries of high politics and provide a detailed account of the daily militancy of these transnational militants. The practices of this daily militancy range from the complex ways of transporting communist literature through the Black Sea and the Mediterranean to the tackling of the question of language in this communist Babylon, to name but few examples.

"2019-11-11 12:01:12",Communication,"Good Societies","This paper will present a new project that envisions possible future societies. The ongoing ecological, economic, political and humanitarian crises are also crises of the imagination, with people asking 'But what are the alternatives?' In this context, a new wellspring of intellectual and activist energy is galvanising, which is prepared to tackle the crisis of imagination and ask the big questions about what those alternatives could be. The Great Transition is part of this movement.||The Good Societies project aims to contribute to this movement. It attempts to answer the central question: What would a 'good' society look like?  It approaches this overarching question through pursuing a series of six interlocking sub-questions:||- What economic models would a good society have?|- What political systems would a good society have?|- What family structures would a good society enable?|- On what scale would a good society operate?|- What media and communications systems would a good society have?|- How do we get there?||A range of possibilities will be explored under each theme - the idea is not to create one answer and one vision but to traverse multiple alternatives, bringing into dialogue diverse intellectual traditions. For example, the sub-question on economic models includes discussions from universal basic income, automation and the reduction of the working week, to degrowth, participatory economics, and ideas around the commons. The 'scale' theme tackles the role of - and alternatives to - the nation-state and new internationalist agendas. The 'family' theme include discussions of gendered unpaid work and ideas around family abolition and child liberation. ||The project combines research and civil society aims, and it sits alongside an existing Amsterdam-based community project that began last year.||The paper will present the aims and objectives of the project, the hybrid theoretical and methodological approach, and some of the key ideas for alternative social structures thrown up by the research so far. |",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Models,1,Laura,Basu,she/her,l.s.basu@uu.nl,"Utrecht University; openDemocracy; Goldsmiths","Laura Basu is an economics editor for the media platform openDemocracy, and a Research Fellow at the Institute for Cultural Inquiry, Utrecht University, and Goldsmiths, University of London.

"2019-11-11 14:37:43",Communication,"Beyond 'man' and 'history': On the conceptual basis of utopias in modernity.","The shift to a secular frame of reference, already well under way in the 17th century (as opposed to the otherworldly/theological one of the middle ages and early Rennaissance) run parallel to another conceptual development: Man emerges as the locus of natural rights -especially political freedom- and as the subject of thought and action. By the mid 18th c., man is even more: the foundational element of political community seen as a form of contract between autonomous individuals.|An alternative, emerging at around the same time (Hegel) and developed in the 19th c. (Marx) poses the economy and society as the subject of history and the unfolding of history towards a telos as an ideal. Even then, this 'unfolding' is expressed also on the level of the subject (Hegel) or implies the realization of man as a species-being (Marx).|These two parallel conceptual directions -man as an essence/presence or history as a given trajectory towards a telos- have marked the modern normative framework and provided the conceptual bases for all forms of utopias up to our days, in the form of Liberal or Marxist approaches respectively. |However, in both cases the ideal is taken as axiomatically given, as always implied or present. Either the essence of man is there and has to be discovered, or history has a telos and moves inexorably towards it. In contrast, our task today is to move beyond both approaches. To reject historicism without falling back to an individualist ideal (as the Frankfurt School did), to think of a better -social- world without essentialist assumptions.|The alternative is not evident. It could be argued that to think ideals and utopias no alternative overall, general assumption is to be applied. Transhistorical elements can exist -for example the long-term survival of human society as such and the provision of the material context for the survival of all individuals (real sustainability). Beyond that, the radical historicity -as distinct from historicism- present in Marxism should be espoused: every period allows its own ideals to emerge. One of the powerful ideals of modernity we can retain is the ability and desire to transform society-we could think democracy but also the organization of the economy along these lines.||",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Models,1,Kanakis,Leledakis,He,kanakis.leledakis@gmail.com,"Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences, Athens, Greece","Kanakis Leledakis studied in Athens (M.Eng.) and at the London School of Economics (Post Graduate Diploma Economics, M.Sc.

It aims at investigating the rhetoric of subjectivity formation within/from storytelling, thereby highlighting a specific form of worlding interaction that takes place while detecting organic multitude as site for encountering.. We hold that through assenting how subjectivity is formed and how this becoming is narrated, we are able to identify, recognize and reify multitude, a multitude that is necessary to detect if we want radically to transform our relationship with nature in the age of the Anthropocene. While human subjectivity is created through inter-human actions, such as with communication, narration and storytelling, we cannot assume that nonhuman (or other-than-human) subjectivity is formed in the same way. In order not to see only our human-selves in nonhuman interaction, a model for human exceptionalism, we propose an investigative, dialectic and inclusive platform for perceiving subjectivity of the multitude is necessary, and we will enact and perform this in our panel.  We believe that understanding any form of discourse as a process of dialectics, we can only reach an understanding for such non-human-centric subjectivity by merging different artistic as well as academic practices. We believe this process to be anti-disciplinary, reaching over into activism, politics and ideology, and thus forcing a future-orientated and utopian discourse into being that includes a plurality of subject-hoods. Our theoretical base is founded on thinkers such as Judith Butler, Louis Althusser, Donna Haraway, Vinciane Despret, and Isabelle Stengers, while our practices include fine art, creative writing, still photography, digital video and computer games. The panel presentation will be performed as one organic body comprised of four researching appendages, interconnected and entangled through nodes of reciprocal relations, all attached to one bastardized creature.   ||References|Althusser, Louis (1971) On Ideology.

To exist in these troubled times, she warns, we must be timeless-past, present, and future at once. We cannot spread doomsday prescriptions for our futures, proclaiming the end of humanity, the demise of the natural world as we know it, and then imagine we can save ourselves, from ourselves.  Whether or not we predict we will succumb or survive the apocalyptic consequences of the human-made tragedy for our dying planet, we must become other-than-human. We must find new ways to express and comprehend the evolving and transformative sites of the thick present, of where we are now (and before, and after). As such, Haraway reminds us that we are """"mortal critters entwined in myriad unfinished configurations of places, times, matters, meanings"""" (1). The challenge then is to express the meaningfulness of our unruliness-to make and unmake our 'selves' into a series of monstrous relations with the others we encounter, to discover our oddkinand become with.  | |But how might we arrange such kinship? Deborah Bird Rose describes the state of shimmer in her evocative article """"Shimmer: When All You Love is Being Trashed."""" She describes the state in relation to Aboriginal Australia, her home for 30 years studying extinction, ecology and multispecies connection. She designates shimmer as an aesthetic appeal to the senses, non-technical, a lure to relations with others, such as with Angiosperms, large flowering plants, and their kinships with their pollinators, like flying foxes (53).  Comparing kinship to Isabelle Stengers state of reciprocal capture, Rose illustrates how finding the ecological pulse of the earth's shimmer is """"a process of encounter and transformation, not absorption, in which different ways of being and doing find interesting things to do together"""" (51).  | |But how might we learn to recognize and mediate these encounters, who might we communicate with, and how, if we are to find our oddkin and move into shimmer?

As Farhang Erfani (2007) has argued, utopia is 'where no one had gone before, but where one had to go to escape the tyranny of the chartered territories'. While we might think of the edges of this territory as conceptually far away and distant, it might be that it is at the distance of the avatar. This paper will examine the ideological implication of perceiving subjectivity in avatars in games. It suggests that utopia might help build a bridge between 'nature' proper and nature transformed by politics. As a technology, avatars produce surrealist and utopian identification in humans, which means that emancipation and revolution are possible through this medium. It is within the realm of the imaginary, but in order to release revolutionary potentials the mechanism of ideological apparatus, as described by Louis Althusser (1971) needs to be taken into consideration. Looking at the avatar through Marxist machine perspective, we can detect how changing relation to nature is shaped by our interaction in a virtual environment. The avatar becomes thus a way to imagine or touch the utopian revolution, if only ideological apparatus would reveal itself to us. Many have been critical of  Althusser's apparatus theory, saying that it is too dogmatic and there is no 'outside' of the theory. Ideology is unavoidable. For Judith Butler (1997), this only means that we should look at performing the interpellation badly, in order to avoid reproducing ideology all over again, but for Nicolas Bourriaud (2016), it means that ideology produces no waste or disposable (the exform), and that no-one or nothing is excluded from ideology, not even avatars. In this theoretical presentation, I will investigate the possibility of the avatar as a way of escaping 'the charted territories', which means to engage constructively with the edges of the known world, with utopia. Can we transform the ways we respond to the 'natural' world by performing ideology badly? Can we perform utopia in ways that transforms our relationship with nature. |",English,"Transforming our Relationship with Nature",Models,1,Lars,Kristensen,he/him,lars.kristensen@his.se,"University of Skövde","Lars Kristensen teaches game development at the University of Skövde.

It's a deeply personal activity, and yet the production of our own narrative is foundational to how we fit into the groups and societies we belong to. How, though, should we address the possibility of changing our narrative response to and within the natural world we inhabit (or, in Haraway's words, quoted above, of being 'capable...of response'?)? How can we resist narrating nature, and instead better listen to the stories being told to us? How too can we work towards establishing and changing our collective narratives? In what ways can the current disconnect between people and the natural world they inhabit be re-viewed and possibly repaired by reflecting on the importance of listening to nature's storytelling, and incorporating what we learn into our own new narratives?||Through a blend of creative nonfiction and critical work, layered with calls for audience participation in narrative-making, I will address these questions and issues, and trace the exploration of how acts of storytelling are always the starting point of any real greater change.|",English,"Transforming our Relationship with Nature",Models,1,Micaela,Maftei,she/her,mickymaftei@hotmail.com,"Victoria BC, Canada",mickymaftei@hotmail.com,"Victoria, BC",Canada,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lissa.holloway-attaway@his.se,"Lissa Holloway-Attaway",,"Safari 12.1 / OS X",90.231.230.175,554613564,"58.391201019287, 13.845100402832"

Adorno's purer aesthetic formalism, which usually tends, by itself, to more radically disconnect art from life. But the complexity of the  The Aesthetic Dimension suggest that Marcuse's solution to the riddle of art and life represents a dialogue not only with other versions of Marxist, Frankfurt school aesthetics, but also with his own earlier versions. One might almost miss Marcuse's real moral points, the subterranean themes of The Aesthetic Dimension: the nature of the self, tragedy, optimism and pessimism, and the power to negate alienated life. This book expresses, often within in a few pregnant sentences, the whole history of Marcuse's five decade ethical-aesthetic analysis of art. What is the fundamental message of Marcuse's final statement on aesthetics as moral and ethical theory? He is more skeptical in this book about the possibility of the conditions of action ever becoming so changed that liberated action could be a transmutation of the form of art.  Art and life are seen as very different. Liberated action can move in the direction of imitating art's formal aesthetic qualities, but there seem to be sharper limits to how far it can go.  In some respects The Aesthetic  Dimension moves closer than ever to Adorno's aesthetic formalism, with its separation between art and life, and very critical of Lucien Goldmann's realistic embeddedness aesthetics, with its claim of a close connection between art and life, Yet in other respects The Aesthetic Dimension in fact aids in reconciling the dimensions of negation of alienation, formalism, and embeddedness realism. ||",English,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,"Norman Arthur",Fischer,he/him,parsquix@aol.com,"Professor of Philosophy, Kent State University, retired","Author of Marxist Ethics Within Western Political Theory: A Dialogue with Republicanism, Communitarianism, and Liberalism",Burlington,U.S.A.,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,parsquix@aol.com,"Norman Arthur Fischer",,"Chrome 75.0.3770.100 / Windows 7",65.183.130.156,554614021,"44.492900848389, -73.225303649902"

Although several factors have changed, the core challenge remained: the oppression of authoritarian structures. In the second half of the 20th century the capitalism entered to its authoritarian neoliberal phase. At the beginning of the 21st century the authoritarian right has rapidly reborn in the field of authoritarian state, which can be called post-fascism. According to my concern, these two tendencies have tightly coupled in the framework of autocratic right-wing populist regimes. Rosa Luxemburg showed that imperialism and imperialist war could not be overcome within the framework of capitalism. The liberal democracy and liberal constitutionalism tried to put this militarist nature of capitalism into legal/constitutional frameworks. The failure of liberal democracy opened the contemporary way of illiberal right-wing populism, which on the one hand remined integrated into neoliberal capitalism and on the other hand dismantled the legal basis of liberal constitutionalism (human rights, rule of law). A new hegemonic structure has been created in the USA under the Trump's administration, in Putin's and Erdoğan's regimes as well, and it is most striking in Eastern Europe especially in the Hungarian Orbán's regime.|I am investigating in this lecture how can the left in Eastern Europe struggle against the reconciliation of authoritarian neoliberalism and authoritarian state ruled by the right. I will argue, based on the Marxist and post-Marxist (Luxemburg, Gramsci) and critical theoretical (Hardt, Negri, Agamben, Laclau, Mouffe) literature, that populist turn of the Left will be necessary but not sufficient: achieving a new hegemony it seems to be inevitable that the left re-discover its anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist origins, because the authoritarian turn of our time is based on the common tyrannical nature of capitalism and right-wing politics.|",English,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Strategies,1,Attila,Antal,He,antal.attila@ajk.elte.hu,"senior lecturer, Eötvös Loránd University Faculty of Law Institute of Political Science","Attila Antal (1985) is holding a PhD in political science.

The first section lays the theoretical grounding for bioeconomy. By linking biopolitics with a Marxist account of class relations and the political economy, I attempt to render the hidden area of Marx and Foucault evident. The second part of this essay focuses on studies and involvement with two Toronto-based non-for-profit organizations. Both NGOs work with poor people, newcomers, immigrants and refugees; and as integral parts of bioeconomy, these organizations garner grand money and funding through rhetoric and politics of care in which the vitality of the immigrant should be 'fostered'. However, as many migrant queers like myself exist without healthcare and substantial support, the politics of care functions more as strategies for bioeconomic gains. The third part inserts the bioeconomy of the queer immigrants into the wider context of carceral capitalism. I look at documents, designs and maps of three migrant holding centres in Canada; I make a case that an economy based on the extraction of time, vitality, human aspiration and dreams is increasingly cantering on poor people whose existence it produces, abhors and re-circulates.

"2019-11-11 20:55:58",Communication,"Ecological Defense and the Dual Power Commune","How does the worsening climate catastrophe alter the political relation between the city and the countryside? Whereas a privileging of the industrial factory as the locus classicus of proletarian liberation once led many to regard factory struggles and occupations as 'progressive' and peasant movements as somehow 'backwards', recent theorizations of ecological land defense movements like the ZAD, as well as the Yellow Vests movement, have sought to overturn this view. Authors like Kristin Ross, Mauvaise Troupe Collective, Phil Neel, and Laurent Jeanpierre have variously argued that the defining conflicts of our current moment descend not from the worker-student action committees of urban centers like Paris, but from the struggles in the near-hinterland against state and economic megaprojects dating back to the 1960's. Movements like the peasants of the Larzac plateau in France in the 1970s, or against the airport in Notre-dame-des-landes more recently, have a surprising contemporaneity in an age of rapid climate apocalypse. This' reversal of the political priority of factory and field for the theory of dual power is linked to a series of other decisive additions, namely, a new orientation toward movement strategy as a 'defensive construction', and a new non-synthetic or pluralistic methodology of organization associated with the process of 'composition'. This paper provides an overview of these arguments, adapting insights to the North American context, while outlining how a new 'place-based', and 'territorial' politics allows us to overcome the limits of the cycle of urban uprisings that dotted the globe this past year. |",English,No,"Transforming our Relationship with Nature",Strategies,1,"Kieran ",Aarons,He/They,kaarons@luc.edu,"Loyola University Chicago",,,,Male,"Member of another marginalized group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kaarons@luc.edu,"Kieran Aarons",,"Chrome 78.0.3904.87 / OS X",24.1.125.197,554679835,"41.852001190186, -88.121101379395"

In particular, theorists were concerned with the concept of consciousness raising.|V.I. Lenin's theory famously argued that consciousness - an understanding of the inner-workings of one's|unfreedom - must be brought to people by revolutionary vanguards. Leninist theory was later challenged when|post-colonial theorists such as Ranajit Guha rejected the claim that people require their consciousness to be|raised by external actors. Guha's work showed that rebels can be conscious on their own terms by highlighting|evidence of oppositional consciousness in peasant insurgents in colonial India. ||Like Guha, I overlay my analysis of class consciousness over recent and relevant instances of popular protest. Reviewing major popular protests in the Middle East and North Africa, I show that Lenin and Guha describe two crucial, but conceptually distinct forms of political consciousness. Guha's articulation of oppositional consciousness, I argue, answers the first form of my initial question: rejecting one's subordinate status through solidarity and self-identification with others of the same status will bring about political contestation. ||Lenin's conception of revolutionary class consciousness answers the second part of my initial question: a cohesive and public counter-ideology to that of the status-quo is required to challenge and shift hegemonic political practices. Guha's oppositional consciousness leads a revolution to what Asef Bayat calls 'revolution as movement': the radical mobilization and solidarity of political subjects against existing powers. However, the deciding factor for whether the political order will shift or restore is dependent on which actor(s) cohesively articulate the source of peoples' unfreedom, as well as a blueprint for a freer order. This is what Bayat deems 'revolution as change,' which he argues failed to materialize during the Arab Spring. Just as Bayat argues for a conceptual distinction between movement and change, my thesis complements his concepts through mirroring conceptions of revolutionary consciousness.

Since 2015 however, trade and social programs between member countries have deteriorated, while regional support for ALBA has declined. Of the iterations of twenty-first century Latin American regionalism, the success of ALBA in particular appears to be contingent on the distinct social, political and economic forces that accompanied the rise of Latin America's pink tide. This paper relies on theories of uneven and combined development to trace the international, regional and national forces and structures that have shaped the development trajectory of the ALBA since it was created in 2005. It argues that ALBA's characteristics are not only constituted by relations between member countries, but are also shaped by international relations of power, and local class politics, which compel states to cooperate at the regional level in order to improve their positioning in the global capitalist system.

Macri's agenda of economic liberalization and austerity combined with the goals of eradicating streets politics and populist patterns of allocation of state resources seemed a cogent strategy to disentangle the problems that had led to economic stagnation and instability and relaunch capital accumulation in the country. As Macri leaves power in 2019 amidst a long recession, fiscal and external crises, spiralling inflation, poor social and labour indicators and an impending debt crisis, discussions about ill-conceived polices and poor policy implementation have intensified.||In this paper, I will argue that Argentina's development failure go beyond Macri's policies and beyond policy formulation and implementation for that matter. Moreover, the focus on policies as the culprit of Argentina's predicament is based on the illusion that the action of the state suffices to address the development dilemmas of the country. This in turn is based on a notion of state autonomy that exaggerates the role of the government's political will and policymaking while neglecting class balances and the ways in which these balances are socially structured and politically expressed.

Extractivism was originally used to describe economies highly dependent on mining and hydrocarbon extraction. It then included monocrop agriculture for export and recently, Sassen (2018) discussed financial accumulation based on student loans with the same concept. This article argues that overstretching the concept confuses extractivism with capitalism, and obfuscates the specificities of the extractive sector: its economic impact, the protests it elicits, and the kinds of relationships it begets between the state, domestic economic elites, multinational capital and exploited classes in countries rich in extractive resources.|Using comparative political economy, this article stresses the necessity to differentiate the underground rent from the ground rent and profits to understand the specificity of extractivism. The underground rent tends to accrue to a very different set of actors, and therefore entails different kinds of social conflicts. This article assesses the role of underground rent in social conflicts in Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile, countries where the extractive sector varies in importance, to better isolate the impact of extractivism on social conflicts that emerge between the state, multinational investors, capitalist classes and the popular sector.

For that, I concentrate on two case studies: (1) Indigenous resistance and climate justice activism in the province, and (2) religious environmentalism in the province (with a focus on - but not limited to- Catholic environmentalism). Indigenous movements are important in this research because of their affinity with the concept of integral ecology (where nature is perceived as a whole and as integrated web of life and relation between living and non-living beings, rather than a fragmented aggregate of entities that can and should be commodified, owned, valued and traded), the possibilities the environmental worldviews they defend offer for an effective """"essential recovery"""", and the fact that they are among the minorities who disproportionally bear climate/environmental injustices in the province, in Canada and around the world. On the other hand, the focus on religious environmentalism in general, and Catholic environmentalism in particular, is to assess the efficacy of religious leaders' calls for climate engagement, particularly Pope Francis' calls for ecological conversion, and the revitalization of the environmental spirituality in Christian traditions, and Christians' social engagements as demanded by the churches' social doctrine. Moreover, the focus on the collaborative actions between the two movements (and possibly with other movements such as, among others, the regional trade unions increasingly asking for the creation of climate jobs that respect both the environment and social justice) is instrumental in developing and implementing a social cohesion environmentalism.|This communication is a partial result of an ongoing research that uses the extended case method and for which, as a participant/believer researcher, I address the neutrality issue by the strong objectivity theory.  The overall objective of the analysis is to provide answer to the following key questions: To what extend do faith-inspired and Indigenous movements share the climate justice agenda and struggles for just transition to a low/post carbon era? And in what ways can the Indigenous-inspired ecological Rematriation and the faith-based ecological conversion (understood in the sense of """"aggiornamento"""" or renewing Ressourcement) be said to be complementary or contradictory?

A history of this conflict and the development of resistant solidarity economies in Chiapas is presented. ||The FARC signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016, and part of the peace agreement deals with the state-sponsored development of a solidarity economy in formerly FARC-held territory through the program 'Social Economies of the Commons'.||These case studies are contrasted and it is then argued that the continuation of the Zapatista conflict without capitulation to the Mexican state allows for a solidarity initiative that preserves its most radical and beneficial aspects, namely indigenously sourced concepts of consensus democracy and environmental stewardship, all while forging new conceptions of indigenous identity and collective autonomy. Additionally, and most importantly, the Zapatista case succeeds in substantively altering the material conditions of the population and mode of production, at least in its immediate local scale. Contrasted with the FARC case, it will be argued that the Colombian peace agreement can be viewed as a Gramscian process of trasformismo in which some appeasement of insurgency groups and their agrarian reform demands are allowed through the introduction of watered-down 'participatory development strategies', while the hegemonic superstructure of capitalist exploitation of rural primary production economies remains in tact.||Concludingly it is argued that the State, in its current form under a global neoliberal regime, is unlikely to facilitate the development of any form of solidarity economy that can substantively challenge neoliberal hegemony. As such, deference to the State as a potential ally in the development of solidarity economies is an unwise strategy for those who wish to transcend neoliberal economics.

The tertiary (or 'service') sector has been identified as having low environmental impacts, suggesting that the environmental harm of economic activity could be reduced by shifting the composition of output from primary and secondary industries to tertiary industries. However, the feasibility of decoupling economic growth from environmental damage via a shift toward services neglects the role of household consumption in economic productivity. Here we show that when household consumption is endogenized in an input-output model, the environmental impact intensities of economic sectors converge. In particular, high-wage, labour-intensive services (e.g. computer technology, R&D) become indistinguishable from what are conventionally considered the worst environmental offenders (e.g. agriculture, manufacturing, utilities). We also show that at the international level, allocating household consumption by labour to employing industries exacerbates the disparities between the environmental impact of developed and developing nations (relative to conventional consumption-based accounts). Our findings suggest that absolute decoupling of the global economy is unlikely to be achieved by transitioning from primary and secondary production to a service-based economy. Assuming that absolute decoupling via technological means is unviable, it follows that changing consumption patterns and transitioning to a growth agnostic or degrowth economic paradigm are needed to create a sustainable society.",English,No,"Transforming our Relationship with Nature",Models,1,Daniel,"Horen Greenford",He/him,d_horeng@live.concordia.ca,"Concordia University, Economics for the Anthropocene","Daniel is a PhD student in the Climate Justice cohort of the Economics for the Anthropocene program at McGill University, working under the supervision of climate scientist Damon Matthews at Concordia University.

There are two central issues that come out of Firestone's argument for the abolition of the family as we know under capitalism. First, she challenges the dreamy and idealistic representation of pregnancy and child rearing in contemporary society and draws attention to the oppression of women due to the psychological, economic and physical implications of pregnancy, childbirth and lactation. Second, she denounces the idea of children belonging to 'their biological parents' and argues for emancipation of children from their parents' egos and as apparatuses to give meaning to otherwise depressing lives of their parents under capitalism. ||Replacing the existing form of the nuclear family requires ideas and practices for alternative forms of kinship and community. Therefore, the speakers will introduce examples from utopian literature such as that depicted by Marge Piercy in her novel Woman on the Edge of Time. After a brief introduction of the novel, with starting questions from the speakers, the participants will discuss ideas and reflections on the alternative forms of 'family' beyond capitalism.||Bibliography:||Lewis, S.

"2019-11-18 18:29:14",Communication,"From Imperative to Opportunity: Radically Restructuring Markets","The most fundamental and feasible path of institutional transformation toward an equitable economy, the present proposal argues, is directly to attack and restructure the role of markets themselves, the """"horizontal"""" relations of capitalism, rather than either focus our concerns solely on """"vertical"""" dimensions of asymmetric power, or attempt simply to regulate or redistribute the effects of markets. Moreover, our aim in attacking the role of markets should not be simply to abolish and replace them with social planning, but rather to erode existing capitalist markets-a form of generalized """"market-as-imperative""""-and expand socialized markets, or delimited """"markets-as-opportunity."""" ||A fundamental insight missing in much contemporary analysis of the economy-not only neoclassical economics but also economic sociology and radical political economy-is that the key differentiating feature of capitalism is neither markets simpliciter nor vertical relations of class or other forms of power (monopoly, property), but rather the social relations of """"generalized markets,"""" from which spring the systematic dynamics distinctive of capitalist economies. This insight stems from a crucial distinction overlooked in most thinking about the economy, between: (a) markets as a realm of opportunity, allowing the free play of individual choice and dispersed information via price-based initiative; and (b) markets as a system of imperatives, whereby market-dependence instituted via generalized commodification works to exert compulsive pressures upon all participants.||The upshot of such generalized markets will predictably be three-fold: (a) to generate a highly asymmetrical end-structure of opportunities and outcomes that all economic actors face and none has chosen; (b) to ensure that the race for such uneven outcomes will itself be highly inequitable, having to do more with background asymmetries in marketable assets than with anything like initiative, diligence or sacrifice; and (c) to unleash an increasingly zero-sum competitive ethos among all participants, who must run to standstill and whose economic activity will be guided by metrics ever-more delinked from defensible social valuations, of the sort required by democratic commitments.||To combat the coercive force of generalized markets-and undo their resulting forms of inequity and alienation-requires a program of strategic decommodification. The guiding aim of such a program would be to expand the zone of real freedom for persons in choosing the terms of their participation in the market, by successively reducing their dependence on the market for access to the """"enabling preconditions"""" for such participation. Fundamental human interests, indispensable for a life of self-realization and democratic community, should not be subjected to generalized markets; rather, markets affecting such interests must be embedded within non-market social relations, meaning institutions or policies that embody an expressly decommodified understanding of the affected interests.||",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Models,1,Talha,Syed,He/him,tsyed@law.berkeley.edu,"UC Berkeley Law","Talha Syed teaches Law and Political Economy at UC Berkeley.",Berkeley,USA,Male,"Person of color",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tsyed@law.berkeley.edu,"Talha Syed",,"Chrome 78.0.3904.97 / OS X",157.131.107.158,556942371,"38.392799377441, -122.7507019043"

These movements, dubbed """"urban trade unionism"""" and broadly associated with """"cadre de vie"""" activism, should be studied in part for their increasingly ambitious definition and pursuit of urban self-management. This paper begins with the CSCV (Confédération Syndicale du Cadre de Vie), and their declaration in favor of urban self-management at their congress in 1972, and ends with the late-decade experimentations the MHGA (Mouvement de l'Habitat Groupé Autogéré) and other smaller urban social movements in France in this period.

The demographic numbers of the tribes are increasing at a rate of 24 per cent per decade (Census 2011). Despite the constitutional safeguards provided by the Indian state to secure political and socio-economic rights (National Commission for Scheduled Tribes 2018), Scheduled Tribes remain one of the most vulnerable and impoverished groups in India.||This research proposal contends that locating factors causing destitution of tribes using 'exclusionary' analysis of tribal policies and programmes, especially in border regions of India, is inefficacious and misleading. While the Indian government has promoted policy tools that enable tribal groups to represent their interests and become collaborators in the policymaking process, state policies of market orientation and globalisation have pushed pastoralists to privatisation and commercialisation of community-regulated resources (Agrawal 2005). In this regard, there is a need to view whether state and market mechanisms function as tools of 'integration' of tribes into the mainstream mode of production which at once exploits and impedes the socio-economic progression of tribal communities.||In this regard, the paper shall locate the shifts in work practices amongst one spatially located, and one pastoral tribe in the Jammu and Kashmir region which bear the burden of living in a state affected by political turmoil. A comparative analysis of shifts in work practices within the two 'sister communities' of Gujjars and Bakkarwals shall allow to locate the impact of historical and contemporary political and economic processes that lead to the divergence in spatiality, and socio-economic disparity within the tribes, which were once viewed as twin- tribes owing to their common historical mode of production. The paper goes beyond contemporary and past literature in seeking to unravel the impact of conflict and globalisation on the nature of work and ownership within Himalayan tribes in the era of post-liberalisation. The paper shall serve as steerage for future labour policy seeking emancipation of Himalayan tribes in the Indian sub-continent.

In the past 20, novel forms of protest have given rise to community economies that contend relationships of extortion, blackmail and libeling. A central asset to this successful project has been the use of tourist techniques that capitalize on immersive experiences of mafia heritage, how they hack stereotypes and put on """"spectacles"""" of noir in a strategic manner to orient others towards the movement. This paper brings forward some key communicative and pragmatic techniques that can be used to energise and expand a political movement through the genre of tourism. In doing so, it problematizes the role that desire and seduction play in the discipline of political economy, which in my view is prevalently described as a force that must be contained, or worse, forcibly repressed. Politics cannot bear to look the economic in the eye, because it cannot control its own reaction to it. Therefore, to prevent the guilt, it veils the affective resonance with cold terms such as """"optimization"""", """"productivity"""", and """"rationality"""". Desire is often impeached as an """"economic sin"""" that signals the presence of immoral relationships.

"2019-11-23 17:43:34",Communication,"Quality of Life for All: Beyond Right to the City","The recent arrest of unlicensed women churros vendors by New York's Transit Police as part of a 'quality of life' crackdown has resonated not only amongst their usual rights-based legal advocates, but also with a wider action-orientated movement seeking to link indigenous struggle and Black liberation in the city. Accordingly, this paper seeks to explain how the rise of informality in deindustrialized New York, along with working practices previously associated with the global South and in combination with a cost of living crisis created by ongoing gentrification, has the potential to bring together previously unaligned sections of the city's working class. If gentrification is """"class war at the level of the built environment"""", in New York this is once again generating widespread grievances against both the local and federal state. Under the sustained conditions of neoliberal austerity, the dual administration of New York has set up a series of contradictory demands that has shifted the priorities of the immigrant and working poor, throwing them into direct competition with each other for spatial use values. Increasingly, the city's poor have had to seek entrepreneurial opportunities in the informal and feminised margins of the economy as an attempt to escape degraded working conditions, experimenting with new survival strategies in order to find any sort of living at all. Meanwhile, the Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) have continued in their efforts to develop the outer-boroughs on behalf of big real estate, with their business-friendly preoccupation with renovating both the image of the city and its infrastructure, determined to expunge the visible presence of immigrant minorities, such as vendors, from the streets. In short, this top-down struggle over spatial representation is critical to the extraction of value from urban space. Central to this renewed endeavour is the recent 'quality of life' crackdown on the subway, which has seen Governor Cuomo's administration reinforce the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) with 500 extra police officers as part of a clampdown on fare evasion; continuing war on the homeless and other impoverished subway users. This criminalization of poverty is seen by many as an attempt to push lower-income, unhoused and immigrant New Yorkers out of valuable areas of the city in a move that seems redolent of the 'bad old days' of the Guiliani administration with its broken windows policing and racially discriminatory stop-and-frisk program. In response, Decolonize This Place (DTP) has called for a series of mass mobilizations in the city. Their tactics have included mass trespassing on the subway and the occupation of a bridge joining Harlem and the Bronx. These mobilizations challenge the meaning of 'quality of life', calling for the suspension of fares on the MTA, whilst being prepared to take action on behalf of marginalized New Yorkers who are often unable to directly contest their own exclusions and right to the city. This represents the adoption of a confrontational attitude toward the NYPD, employing the framework of new abolitionism and decolonization in a way that is markedly different to the 'defensive' strategies previously developed by the city's patchwork of legal advocacy and unionizing efforts. Over the past 30 years New York's NGO/advocacy organisations have innovated novel forms of legal and juridical contestation, yet they have often been constrained by their emphasis on pressurizing local state politicians into reluctantly enacting reform. Similarly, in terms of action, they have been circumscribed by their 'invisible stakeholders'; the philanthropic foundations that fund them. These advocacy efforts have since the late-70s focused their organizing amongst ethnically marginalized sectors of the workforce in locally-bound enclaves in the city; often only working in tandem with each other as and when their interests align. In terms of generalizing discontent, this paper highlights the limits of rights-based advocacy and organizing organizations in New York. This model was recently criticized by Angela Davis at an event for Take Back the Bronx, that was convened on the issue of incarceration and the closing of Rikers Island, where she took aim at the agenda of the Ford Foundation which funds many of these small-scale organizing efforts and which represents a certain orthodoxy in terms of directing grassroots attempts to transform the polity of the city. Instead, the tactics of movements such as Decolonize This Place ambitiously take direct aim at the racialized neo-colonization of the inner city, enacted through exclusionary settler-colonial and carceral logics, embracing tactics recently witnessed during transit strikes in Brazil, France, Hong Kong and Chile. As such, it remains to be seen if these more immediate strategies of spatial contestation are sufficient and whether their horizon is yet delineated.

The notion of rhythm is extended from music to a form of knowledge, language, and being derived from West Africa that is radically distinct from dominant Euro-American culture, embodying a sense of time which is antithetical to capitalist temporality along with an oppositional relation to the body in social space. I will discuss how rhythm has been a vital source of insurrection from the time drums were used in slave revolts, but also consider how capital has commodified and incorporated African-American music, culture, and style, culminating in the massive global enterprise that is contemporary hip-hop-in sum, a dialectical conflict between resistance and what Lefebvre called """"recuperation"""" within the conditions of capitalism.

With certain similarities to Trump, both Modi and Erdogan rose to power by addressing popular frustrations associated with globalization, linking them to nativist cultures of fear and frustration and at the same time politicking on the perceived opportunities for geopolitical assertion posed by the new order. Consequently the Indian and Turkish states are now aggressively attempting to reconfigure social relationships in the mold of neoliberalism while stoking nativist sectarianism - a complex dynamic best understood through the lens of geopolitical economy. This communication suggests that this nativist neoliberalism can be countered by the left by organizing not only against neoliberalism, but also against nativist culturalism, national chauvinism, and a world order where empires and imperial aspirants vie for power also manipulating these culturalisms.

Accordingly, the articulation of leftist goals must resonate with people in concrete ways, so that it becomes obvious how the achievement of those goals would improve their day-to-day lives. This means building movements that offer continual improvement and which attempt to avoid asking already-vulnerable people for short-term losses on the abstract promise of long-term gains. Such an approach is not a recourse to mere reformism but an attempt to recast how the left engages workers and the oppressed in terms of the full spectrum of their lives. This spectrum encompasses established lines of racial, gender, and status differences. Can the traditions of workers' inquiry and intersectionality be joined and built upon? This communication suggests they can but, in the context of decades of rightist ideologies of division and hate, they only offer starting points for organizing strategies for viable left movements. Such strategic development demands, first of all, that we understand precisely how right-wing ideology and culture retains such a popular appeal in so many spaces.

"2019-11-24 13:37:50",Communication,"Promises, traces, outlines, islets: Althusser's metaphors for communism emerging in the margins of capitalist society and their relevance for strategic debates today","In 1976 Louis Althusser delivered a lecture at the Catalan College of Building Engineers and Technical Architects. When Althusser incorporated parts of this text in Les vaches noires (one of his unpublished manuscripts from the 1970s) he referred to 'esquisses et promesses du communisme' (outlines and promises of communism). There is also in the archives another French version of the text that refers to 'esquisses et traces du communisme' (outlines and traces of communism). Also in Les vaches noires Althusser refers to the 'îlots de communisme' (islets of communism) emerging where there is free association and liberation from commodity relations. This point can be linked to Althusser's insistence that communism can emerge in the margins or interstices of capitalism in a manner similar to capitalism emerging at the interstices of feudalism. All these metaphors point towards some important open question for Althusser, but also for anticapitalist strategy in general: Is communism just a political project or a political design for a post-capitalist society or is the projection, elaboration and expansion of social forms already appearing within contemporary capitalist society as a result of collective struggles, resistances, experimentations that bring forward the collective ingenuity of the subaltern classes and groups? Can a political project for radical social transformation can simply be a generalization of dynamics emerging within contemporary social dynamics or it is also then attempt to organize, coordinate, think this process which combines both the accentuation of antagonism and the attempt towards the destruction of existing social forms and the attempt to put in place new social relations? If we take into consideration the radical contingency that is at the heart of the notion of the encounter that Althusser's aleatory materialism is based upon, how can we rethink the relation between the 'conscious' and the 'spontaneous' aspects of communist politics? The aim of this presentation is to attempt to revisit the tensions of Althusser's thinking of communism emerging at the margins or interstices of capitalist society and then try to think their relevance for contemporary strategic debates in an attempt to rethink the politics of emancipation as politics of organizing the social and political and intellectual conditions for the collective experimentation and ingenuity of the subaltern and to suggest that this is exactly the challenge of a 'new practice of politics'.

Yet, Nigeria does not come to mind as the likely African country where transition could happen. There are growing movements in Nigeria challenging the status quo and demanding for reforms that might lead to transition. Moving out from an extractivist economy and political hierarchy, is a question of survival for many Nigerians. This roundtable is an opportunity to analyse the current context and to discuss with Nigerian social movements' leaders and allies in order to enhance our understanding of the challenges and needed strategies to support the transitions movements. ||With a population projected to grow from more than 186 million people in 2016 to 392 million in 2050, Nigeria is becoming the most densely populated country in Africa and one of the largest population of youth in the world.

With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter and currently 6th largest world oil exporter and the largest natural gas reserves on the continent, Nigerian are struggling against the natural resources curses. ||The country continues to face massive developmental challenges, which include the need to reduce the dependency on oil and diversify the economy, address insufficient infrastructure, and build strong and effective institutions, as well as governance issues and public financial management systems. The nation remains low on the human development index (157nd out of 189). Economic growth does not benefit development, poverty continues to rise and inequalities to deepen.||Currently, Nigeria is facing multiple crisis: the Boko Haram situation in the northern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, the agro-pastoralist conflict in the Middle Belt, as well as the environmental degradation in the Delta. All of these crisis are leading to forced migration, increased inequality, ethnic tensions, and even reviving reminiscence of the Biafra war. These multiple faces crisis are deeply rooted in the contradictions thrown up by the oil-dependent global capitalist system and the processes of liberal globalisation. However, Nigeria are getting organized and demanding for transition. ||The speakers will shed light on the current situation and the raising of new voices and social movements demanding for political, economic and environmental transitions. ||Dr. Isaac Asume Osuoka will present the Civil Rights Council experience in building up popular movement for below in Nigeria,||Emem Okon will explain how grassroots women organizations in the Niger Delta are raising their voice and leading movement for transitions in the Delta. ||Devlin Kuyek will present the case of the Alliance Against Industrial Plantations in West and Central Africa, including Nigeria, and how communities are organizing and fighting against large-scale oil palm plantations. ||The roundtable will be moderated by Geneviève Talbot who has been in international solidarity work for the last fifteen years and has been working in Nigeria for the last two years. |",Bilingual,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,3,Talbot,Genevieve,genvio@yahoo.com,"Isaac Asume",Osuoka,"Dr. ",asume@saction.org,"York University ","Dr Isaac 'Asume' Osuoka coordinates Social Action International, an organisation promoting resource democracy and the human rights and livelihoods of marginalised communities in West and Central Africa.

The economic theories of Karl Marx are thus acutely valuable in understanding this relationship. ||The privatization of the land, tools, and means of production; the atomization of society into discrete, competing vendors of individual labor power; the inexorable creation of the relative surplus population, or the reserve army of the unemployed; and the tyranny of dead labor over living labor within the relations of production (i.e., labor forced to accommodate the needs of capital, rather than vice-versa).

This transformation has been well documented by various studies from all around the globe. From Callinios to Brown, scholars have been demonstrating the drastic effects of changing university conditions on researches, on faculty, on post-graduate students and on academic disciplines themselves. However only a few of these studies focus on the questions of how does neoliberalism affect the educational lives of the undergraduate students and how could we resist this?||Jacques Ranciere, in his famous book, The Ignorant Schoolmaster, argues that education or a pedagogy as a discipline of social sciences must have an emancipatory logic. This, according to Ranciere, could only be brought about by changing the hierarchical relationship between teachers and learners established in the classroom: equality of the minds must be the emancipatory principle. ||This paper argues that Ranciere's arguments could provide a micro strategy for us in replacing the neoliberal 'student-focused education' where all undergraduate students identify themselves as 'customers' with democratic classroom relationship.

(Arendt, Human Condition, 246)||In the Fall of 2012, in the shadow of the failure of peace talks, mass arrests of KCK members and many others, and the continuing isolation of Abdullah Ocalan, Kurdish political prisoners in Turkey undertook a mass, indefinite hunger strike that, by its end, dragged on for some 66 days, having entered the 'death zone' by day 45 before it was called off by Ocalan. The hunger strike was deemed 'blackmail' by (then) Prime Minister Erdogan and, perhaps more surprisingly, as an illegitimate act of 'oppression and force' by the European Parliament's Rapporteur on Turkey. While pointedly part of the ongoing struggles in Turkey, these reactions to it also reveal a wider strain in democratic theory and in reactions to Kurdish struggles: The first sometimes suggests formal democracies cannot accommodate nor do they require radical protest politics, while the latter continues to interpret Kurdish resistance as (inherently?) 'separatist' and 'violent'-and as fueled by death.||In this paper, I interrogate these assumptions and analyze the hunger striking as a 'democratic act' of resistance by drawing on interviews with these hunger strikers and conversations with their supporters, lawyers, journalists, and KCK trial translators that I undertook in the summers of 2014, 2016, and 2017 in Diyarbakir, Urfa, and Istanbul. I have asked questions like: How do the hunger strikers and their supporters explain their extreme bodily protest? Do they view it as part of democratic politics, as a rejection of 'the state,' or as a rejection of Turkey? How do they articulate and explain their demands? And, what is their evaluation of the 'success' of the hunger strike both then and later? ||The paper brings interpretive research together with a theoretical lens. I interpret the hunger strikers' and supporters' positions and reasons through Hannah Arendt's conception of politics and 'natality'-""""beginning something new,"""" that """"faculty which is inherent in action"""" -- and argue that the theoretical orientation of death-centred analyses that are prevalent today-e.g. Banu Bargu (on necroresistance), Achille Mbembe (on necropolitics), and Stuart J. Murray (on thanatopolitics)-do not adequately capture the political orientation of this hunger strike. ||The hunger strikers' responses are evaluated in the context of injustice and oppression against which it was undertaken, by the character of the means that were deployed, and by the demands they made. Rather than illegitimate deployment of force corrosive of democracy ('blackmail' or 'oppression and force'), the hunger strike, I argue, was a democratic act of resistance. Rather than thanato- or necro-politics or necroresistance, the hunger strike drew on 'life' and the risk of the hunger strikers' deaths rather than on death itself. And the risk to life was undertaken in pursuit of a new beginning, for new life, for a new form of life. In fact, it aimed at new forms of life. It demanded legal life in the face of civil death; political and cultural life for Kurds against political and cultural death; and democratic, egalitarian, and pluralistic life for all in Turkey in the face of the death of democratic politics in an increasingly authoritarian state. Its demand for an 'equal right to co-existence' (Habermas) was coupled with a vision of a radically democratic new form of life for and in Turkey.||This hopeful political action based in the radically democratic aims of democratizing the state and society in Turkey had, however, been increasingly called into question, doubted, and perhaps rejected by some of the hunger strikers themselves by 2017. As democracy is killed in Turkey (a particular form of necropolitics) by the AKP, Kurdish natality may be turning toward more separatist politics. |",English,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,"Amy ",Bartholomew,,amybartholomew@cunet.carleton.ca,"Associate Professor in the Department of Law and Legal Studies at Carleton University","Amy Bartholomew is an associate professor in the Department of Law and Legal Studies at Carleton University, Ottawa.

Almost every year since 2015, there was one form of election -be it a general or local one, or a referendum-, which did nothing but displayed the strictly divided state of order of the society into two uncompromising halves. After one of these electoral confrontations, namely after the April 2017 Referendum, the ruling AKP launched a sui generis presidential system, abolishing the country's established parliamentary order and centralizing all power in the hands of the President. So far, the outcome has been the development of personalized, politicized, non-transparent, and discretionary decision making processes, and the coercive suppression, criminalization, and humiliation of all sorts of opposition to the government. More importantly, the prevailing social and political impasse cannot be overcome by any of the existing modern bourgeois institutions of Turkish capitalism including the parliament, political parties, state institutions, professional chambers, trade unions, and/or civil society organizations.||This paper aims to problematize this impasse as an outcome of the processes of financialization the AKP has administered since 2002. By highlighting the class-based historical specificities of the process, the paper will propose that financialization has helped the AKP form Turkey's strong neoliberal state -one, strong vis-a-vis labor, but more subordinate to capital- throughout the 2000s and under highly favourable global monetary conditions, while the general as well as Turkey-specific crisis-ridden implications of this process become clear only in the 2010s by the end of the global monetary glut. The paper will argue that under the current conditions, the AKP has been redefining the Turkish state as a 'crisis state' in order to manage the current class contradictions it had itself led to while de- and re-constituting the labouring classes in and through financialization in the 2000s. This means a state that not only reproduces itself within crises, but also manufactures crises, and contrary to the conventional meaning of 'crisis' as a temporary situation, it might acquire permanence if not contested. |",English,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,"Pınar ",Bedirhanoglu,,eflani@metu.edu.tr,"Visiting Professor in the Department of Politics at York University","Pınar Bedirhanoglu is Associate Professor in the Department of International Relations at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, while currently she is Visiting Professor in the Department of Politics at York University, Toronto, Canada.

Besides its physical toll, the conflict has had significant political as well as psycho-affective consequences for the various populations it has and continue to impact. ||The analyses of and political responses to this conflict have varied. The dominant approach - including the one assumed by the Turkish state - has viewed the issue as one of security. The 'securitization' of the Kurdish 'problem' has not been confined to the nationalist right of the political spectrum but also has permeated the Turkish 'left', a significant part of which has viewed the Kurdish conflict as a case of terrorism. ||In this paper, I will focus on the period beginning with the so-called Peace Process that started in 2013, and survey the discourses of a number of 'left' political actors on the Kurdish conflict with a particular emphasis on the Republican People's Party (CHP), the main opposition in Turkish Parliament. Based on a critical reading of the various discourses, I will argue that a radical re-conceptualization of the 'left' is necessary in the Turkish context. Challenging the mainstream conception(s) that confines the left to (relatively) egalitarian wealth distribution and secularism, the paper will argue that a better conceptualization would rather be based on the principle of - social, political and economic - 'emancipation' that goes beyond the current narrowness of the concept in much of Turkish mainstream politics. |",English,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,"Baris ","Karaagac ",,baris.karaagac@gmail.com,"Baris Karaagac is a professor in International Development Studies at Trent University","Baris Karaagac is a professor in International Development Studies at Trent University, Canada.

In the process, the urban warfare waged against the Kurdish movement has been transposed into low-intensity warfare against all kinds of """"suitable enemies"""" for the deployment of police power. This transposition also deepens the extra-legal character of the police violence reflecting the normalization of extrajudicial punishment against the marginalized populations, as well as political dissidents. Contrary to the liberal arguments, therefore, what is at stake here is not an 'excessive' or 'disproportionate' or 'exceptional' use of force by the police, but a selective deployment of police violence as """"ordinary punishment, and therefore as a form of retributive justice"""" (à la Fassin) in a gendered and racialized class rule violently fashioned. ||This paper intends to develop a critical exposition of the violent urban order fabricated through police power in Turkey in the 2010s.

The latest riots in Latin America, the Middle East, movements like Gilets Jaunes are all repercussions of the escalation of the income inequality, precarization of work, unemployment especially among the youth. These riots can spread country-wide very quickly, challenge the political and socioeconomic landscape deeply but in most of the cases retreat as fast as they burst onto the scene. In most cases they do not leave an institutional legacy.   This is mostly the result of the neo-liberal hegemony supported by developed state capacities. The technological improvements provide the states with an opportunity of increased surveillance techniques. Consequently, the fading but still existing neo-liberal hegemony can still prevent the class from regaining its central position in understanding our societies. This not only true for academic work in sociology or political science, it has a direct link with the enduring weakness of the class movements.   This causes a great abnormality. Although class conflict is still the main force motivating the political clashes, it is generally invisible in its own voice. It can not become the center of a counter hegemonic historical bloc but in general it is represented by other political actors.|The """"populist moment"""" is directly related with this interregnum. The existence of the class distinctions are playing their role to demolish the """"central"""" left and right political movements but """"the class"""" can not build its sovereign subjectivity as a result of some ideological ( new political movements, post-Marxism, post-structuralism) and existential ( stratification of the class itself, middle class issue, precariousness, post-Fordism, outsourcing) factors. This argument does not mean that class conflicts can be interpreted purely leaving their cultural aspects aside. I definitely approve that class conflicts in all cases express themselves enmeshed with other kinds of social conflicts. But the total disappearance of class conflict and actors in the public scene results in a complete liquefaction of independent subaltern politics. |This disappearance of """"the class"""" results in the """"culturalization"""" of the political struggles. This trend makes it difficult for the working classes to build up their sovereign political actor and instead lead them jumping on the bandwagon. This situation reminds Marx's analysis of the peasantry in the 18th Brumiare of Louis Napoleon. If a class can not represent itself, it is represented by the others. |The Turkish political scenery has been a good example of this since 2002. The working classes has been mostly represented by a layer of peripheric bourgeoisie ( """"Anatolian tigers"""") whose political representative AKP has reigned since then. The Gezi Revolt in 2013 indicated the disengagement of the urban middle classes from the ruling party, but the blue-collared working classes have mostly supported AKP until the economic crises which started in 2018 and continues with the retrogressive life standards of all the working and middle classes. Now this support has started to erode as well. |At this critical juncture can the working classes in Turkey act as a sovereign political actor and create a political movement to lead the middle classes with a radical wealth redistribution and economic democracy program? I believe we are in political moment where we must build up the class sovereignty from upside down by a political movement with a radical economic program to decommodify the labour. |If I need to illustrate some of the items in this program;|	Free universal basic services financed by taxation from the ultra-reach dollar billionaires. Free potable tap water (5 m^3  per person), free electricity, free public transportation, free internet|	Abolishing all the preconditions necessary for being able to reach the Unemployment Insurance benefits.

"2019-11-25 14:33:56",Communication,"Rethinking internationalist solidarity beyond hegemonic totality of capitalist modernity","As opposed to uni-directional solidarity that reproduces power relations, new internationalism can be understood as autonomously working together on a global level, against intersecting forms of oppressions. However, this new form of internationalism faces certain intellectual and practical deadlocks emerging from its orthodox conception that is concurrent with real-existing socialism. Mainly functioning as a master frame for the majority of left-leaning solidarity networks, this orthodox conception appears to be essentially problematic due to its modernist and nation-statist core. Conventional conception of internationalist solidarity, by definition, rests on the 'proletariat' of 'all lands'. This definition, while holding an important ground against capitalist exploitation, rests on the implicit or explicit recognition (1) of industrialism (2) the exploitation of nature, (3) of nation-state border, and (4) of patriarchal social structures. And these all are continuously reproduced by (5) our rationalist way of social science making. These categories, according to Abdullah Öcalan, are constitutive of the hegemonic and systemic totality of capitalist modernity, whereas the new internationalism needs necessarily to be defined beyond this totality. ||Critically engaging with the debate on internationalist solidarity internal to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the practice of solidarity with the Rojava revolution, I seek to develop an alterative conception of international solidarity that comprehends social multiplicity autonomous and relationally, against intersecting forms of dominations as part of capitalist modernity. The argument is presented in two steps. I show, firstly, that conventional praxis of international solidarity reinforces this totality by obfuscating the interdependent relationality of the components of capitalist modernity. Secondly, that the conditions for a """"new"""" internationalism are given rise to by the very crisis of capitalist modernity, which enables a redefinition of political agency globally. The argument presented here builds on a number of workshops that I participated, or led to. Bringing activists of different background together, these workshops were organized specifically with the goal of a deeper and broader debate on the conditions of new internationalism.|",English,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,Yasin,Sunca,he/him,yasin.sunca@uni-bielefeld.de,"Bielefeld university & Ghent university",,,,Male,"Member of another marginalized group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yasin.sunca@uni-bielefeld.de,"Yasin Sunca",,"Chrome 78.0.3904.108 / OS X",194.94.18.168,558856968,"52.033298492432, 8.5333003997803"

Currently mainstream discussions addressing problems in agriculture build from a context embedded in the logics of the market and several times removed from ecological communities of reciprocity. These discussions, though often well-intentioned, are constrained by an inability to imagine possibilities outside of the established order and invisibilize the non-capitalist forms of economy that exist currently, or could exist. By exploring the role of technology, diverse economies, interconnectedness and the transformative potential of social movements, this panel aims to decenter the logics of capitalism and re-center agriculture's present and futures around care, community, democracy and well-being for all beings.

For example, the degrowth movement calls for diverse economies centered around plural values as opposed to economic growth; these are both invisibilized and trivialized as elite 'alternatives' to capitalism. Similarly, industrial agriculture, via its application of neoliberal and capitalist logics, trivializes agroecology as an """"alternative"""" and insufficient approach to food production. In employing logics antithetical to those of capitalism, both degrowth and agroecology stand in opposition to the dominant system. More importantly, both articulate and enact utopian futures. This exemplifies what Mooney and Hunt (2009) describe as a sharp key framing, or a collective action framing that challenges dominant and institutionalized social and discursive conventions.

Preliminary results from a qualitative study in Vermont suggest that this is because people pursue non-instrumental relational values when producing food for sharing or their own consumption. In principle, greatly increasing the share of society's food coming from labor-inefficient non-market production systems would necessarily coincide with economic degrowth.

"2019-11-25 15:26:45",Communication,"The Language of Electoral Reform in Canada","The recent federal election in Canada has reignited debate around the issue of electoral reform. For the first time in federal history, the 'runner up' in terms of the popular vote won a plurality of seats in parliament -the Liberal Party (33.1%) having received 157 out of 338 seats - and enough to secure a minority government. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party (34.4%) won its share of 121 seats, the NDP (15.9%) 24 seats, the Bloc Quebecois (7.7%) 32 seats, and the Greens (6.5%) 3 seats. Following on the heels of a 2015 federal election in which the Liberal Party campaigned on the promise of electoral reform, the issue was quickly abandoned once the Liberals had secured a dominant majority government. At the provincial level, campaigns around electoral reform have spurred referendums in BC (2005, 2009, 2018) as well as PEI (2019), all of which ultimately failed at the ballot box.|This paper will analyse the discursive strategies of political actors in promoting and discouraging electoral reform. Through an analysis of the aforementioned campaigns on electoral reform, this paper utilises Norman Fairclough's CDA approach to assess the rhetoric of political actors, as well as the media's representation of electoral reform. This paper has three primary areas of focus: (i) the ways in which actors attempt to decontest (Freeden, 1996) particular understandings of concepts such as representation, democracy, and community in mobilising support for and against electoral reform (ii) the utilisation of electoral reform as part of a broader 'progressive' campaign strategy by political actors (iii) the promotion of the status quo FPTP by mainstream media. Thus, this paper is an attempt to expound the effectiveness of particular discourses surrounding this issue as well as interrogate the potentialities for future endeavours in electoral reform.||Keywords: Canadian politics, electoral reform, political communication",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,Rimmy,Riarh,He/him,riarh@yorku.ca,"York University, Department of Politics","I was raised in Surrey, B.C., and completed my BA at the University of British Columbia (Political Science, History), and MA at the University of Toronto (Political Theory).

"2019-11-25 16:40:32",Communication,"The first three decades of the Revolution in Venezuela: The transformation of Venezuela since 1989","	This paper describes how the Bolivarian Revolution continues to inspire Venezuelans, even with all its problems.  In spite of narratives that claim that the revolution (See, e.g.;(Skocpol); (Wootton); (Wolin); (Davidson) (Comninel); for definitions of revolution) in Venezuela has by 2020 faded into (painful?) memory for many Venezuelans, their power in both the state and society remains manifest and under their control.  While subjected to various trials and tribulations for different reasons, including Imperialist attacks from outside of Venezuela and an increasingly desperate violent opposition, many Venezuelans desire to deepen, maintain, and broaden the revolution.  In fact, contra to the claims of a """"problematic"""" rise of authoritarianism, many desire to increase the revolutionary pressure on both state and society, insofar as it is their state and society, their revolution.  They continue to find meaning in the fifth motor of people's power in the form of Chavista governmental practice but more importantly through the development of community councils, communes, and the many other communal projects that have emerged simultaneous with this practice (See, e.g, (Zúquete); (McCoy); (Lopez Maya); (Ciccariello-Maher """"Dual Power in the Venezuelan Revolution""""); (Hawkins); (Gibbs); (Fernandes)) (Ciccariello-Maher Buildcommune))..  Venezuelans themselves claim that they are working towards a communal state as against both capitalism and the capitalist state in Venezuela.  However, these afore-mentioned facts are much disputed, such that millions of Venezuelans' voices are silenced and the political community of the masses is erased, whereas this political community is a historical reality that has remained consistent since this political community first took shape in Venezuela in February 1989, and which was consolidated following Hugo Chávez Frias's election in 1998.  Nevertheless, this attempt at erasure has also been consistent.|	In short, the revolutionary situation and the current government of the revolution continues to be mass-based, mass supported, and continues to offer an alternative to what Margaret Thatcher once claimed had no alternative.  Likewise, Venezuela, and its systems of people's power, is equal to and even surpasses the legitimacy of almost all other political communities found in the world at this moment.|	At the present conjuncture, although Venezuela remains isolated in Latin America and the prospects of continuing the Bolivarian Revolution look dim, this paper will argue that Venezuela remains better situated than is commonly suspected.  This paper reports on twenty in-depth interviews conducted in July, 2018 with people from diverse communities across Venezuela and also reviews the comparativist literature on Venezuela.  This paper strongly diverges from the dominant analyses by reformulating the history of Venezuela since 1989 as Venezuelans themselves have lived it.  Like EP (Thompson), who showed that the working classes """"made themselves as much as they had been made,"""" I will argue that Venezuela's social revolution, i.e., the Bolivarian movements as organized through Chavismo, has been made by Venezuelans themselves.  Moreover, that these movements, this revolution, have made and continue to constitute, in the most profound way, the political community of Venezuela.  The same imperative that drove EP Thompson """"...to  rescue ... [the English Working Class of the early eighteenth century], from the enormous condescension of posterity"""" informs this paper, and as he continues """"causes which were lost in England might, in Asia or Africa, yet be won.""""  Thus, we must ask, what does it mean for Venezuelans to win and can Venezuelans win?  The good news is that the Venezuelan masses have for the past few decades shown themselves to be quite capable of rescuing themselves, and thus, let us listen and learn from them.|Abstract	1/3)					||Bibliography||Ciccariello-Maher, George.

"2019-11-25 16:41:50",Communication,"What Can We Do with Collective Worker Ownership of Shares? Lessons from the Swedish case","As capitalism continues to face a deepening crisis of legitimacy, the question of worker ownership is back on the political agenda. In the anglophone world today, the British Labour Party and the Bernie Sanders campaign are both proposing a workers' ownership fund, which would mandate a portion of corporate shares to be transferred to worker-owned funds for a certain period. These proposals for worker's funds target at no less than ownership of means of production, whose private control is the fundamental feature of capitalism. But would accumulation of shares really lead to socialism, or would it become an efficient way of taming the working-class by creating a shared interest in corporate profitability? I explore the potentials and pitfalls of collective worker ownership by primarily drawing from the heated political struggles and debates around the Wage-Earner Funds (fonds de salarié-e-s) in Sweden in the 1970s; the original plan in 1975 stipulated that the funds would eventually reach majority ownership through continual transfer of shares without limit. Rudolf Meidner and Anna Hedborg, union researchers who developed the original plan, saw it as the eventual basis of a post-capitalist society. But there were only limited efforts to articulate it more directly with a broader vision of transformation that worker control of means of production would bring to society, failing to fully harness the """"artistic critique"""" of capitalism (Boltanski and Chiapello 2005) generated by the New Left. Consequently, despite broad support among the workers, the plan failed to spark an active mobilization to overcome opposition of the Social Democratic leadership as well as the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the Wage-Earner Funds proposal shifted towards variants with an emphasis on capital accumulation without any emancipatory consequences for workers, and its implementation in 1983 hardly shifted class power. I argue that collective share ownership has a robust emancipatory potential only if it is conceptualized as part of a strategy to create an alternative, feminist and ecological mode of social production and reproduction, which can inspire mass mobilization and participation.

"2019-11-25 16:43:16",Communication,"Reading Marx in the twenty-first century:  Rethinking practical communism","	Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote that any attempt to get beyond Marx, either just regresses to pre-Marxist thought or is an overt return to his actual thought.  In reading Marx for the twenty-first century there is much to reconstruct after the long years of barbarism in the world after his death.  But as can be presumed, Marx himself is one of the main pathways into another world.|	After 1989, and the declinations of """"actual existing socialism"""", it has become passé to discuss communism, but this could be a very fortune moment to attempt to reconstruct the concept of Communism as utilized by Marx, especially given the various crises of marxism (which of course, reflect crises in all human sciences common to societies with relations of ruling).|	In this regard to begin this reconstruction, it is first necessary to briefly follow Marx's examination of the closely related terms of both alienation and emancipation, before revealing his purpose in calling communism the practical movement towards emancipation.  But what does this mean?  This paper will trace out these concepts in order highlight their interconnected relation with each other, their circuity, and their mutual composition.  If human development is blocked by how humans relate to each other, the only thing to do is for humans to work together to break this blockage, then communism is the means by which humans not only self-emancipate and end alienation, but also practically change their world.  |	Emancipation from alienation needs to be a practical exercise based in the social movements which are moving towards self-emancipation through full sided human development.  This paper will examine various writings of Marx, both elderly and youthful to propose a Marx whose clarity is often disparaged, but whose political argument is firm, and whose practical politics have yet to be explored.  As Sartre further quoted Che Guevara, """"it is not our fault that the truth is Marxist,"""" and we have much to do, before Marx will no longer be true.||  Abstract 2/3|",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Models,1,Jeremiah,Gaster,He/him,J_gaster@hotmail.com,"York University","Jeremiah Gaster, Ph.D. Candidate, is both a political theorist and a comparativist, and as such is deeply interested in the study of both everyday life and the totalities and relations of power that structure everyday life.

"2019-11-25 16:44:05",Communication,"Hegemony as Intra-Party Relations; Divergent Trajectories of Labour Parties in Sweden and Britain","The question of political parties is at the center of left strategies for democracy and power, and it is one that allows for no easy answers. In this paper, I seek to deepen and enrich theories of internal power contestations in political parties by interpreting theories of Michels and Gramsci together. Robert Michels proposes general mechanisms in which concentration of power in the hands of the leadership inexorably occur even in left parties, and hence thwarting any possibilities of democratization of society. Antonio Gramsci, on the other hand, focuses on the need for a party to unify the working-class and then exercise a hegemonic leadership over other classes, based on substantive consent rather than mere despotism. I argue that hegemony can also be understood as relations within a party between leaders and members, which is more applicable to some parties than others; hegemonic relations within parties is one way in which Michelsian oligarchical tendencies function. A comparison of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the British Labour Party since the 1970s can illustrate this point clearly. In the Swedish party, open, organized dissent hardly existed; it was successful in maintaining support of members through skillful management of dissent, as well as the real gains of the welfare state that the party leadership delivered through their long years in government. But hegemonic incorporation of members meant that when the leadership rejected the socialist Wage-Earner Funds plan despite its popularity among the grassroots activists, the latter were unable to effectively organize against the leadership, dooming the plan to failure and leaving the party's neoliberal turn unimpeded. On the other hand, the British Labour Party in the 1970s saw creation of an organized grassroots opposition to press for socialist policies and greater intra-party democracy. While these movements were ultimately unable to prevent the party leadership's shift towards neoliberalism that culminated in Tony Blair's leadership, they were never able to win hegemonic consent of their members; and the political as well as institutional legacies of the organized opposition facilitated the dramatic rise of Jeremy Corbyn to party leadership in 2015. The comparison highlights that, even though hegemonic leadership within left parties may appear beneficial as it fosters party unity, it eventually stifles their capacity to act as an agent of radical transformation of society.

"2019-11-25 16:45:08",Communication,"What is a social revolution?","	Revolutions have long been contested as a social phenomenon, in both real life and as a concept within academia.  There have been several baseline assumptions about revolutions and social revolutions that require further examination before they can be confirmed as accurate.  In this paper, I propose to isolate one particular form or outcome of revolution, social revolution, in order to identify key dynamics and challenges of this form.  In order to accomplish this, I will reconstruct the foundational concepts of the """"social question"""" and of """"revolutions,"""" delineating the concept of """"social revolutions"""" and their social phenomena from the social phenomena of revolutions.  Drawing on my ongoing research project, this paper presents some critical findings on social revolutions and expands the argument that social revolutions are one of the few moments when aspirations of human emancipation from relations of domination, repression, exploitation, and oppression are actually possible.|	Theda Skocpol (1979, 4) writes that social revolutions are the moment of """"rapid, basic transformations of a society's state and class structures"""" that are """"accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below"""".  In answer to this, I argue that rather than accommodating or responding to the masses, social revolutions are moments when the masses control the political community and have begun to ask critical social questions that have no easy answers.  To start, this paper focuses on the meaning of the """"social question,"""" then by examining revolutions as a specific form of collective political action, I will focus on social revolutions as a specific type, form, or period, of revolutions.  The paper concludes with some political possibilities and potentialities of the socio-political phenomena of social revolutions.  I posit that social revolutions are unique phenomena and are distinctly different from other revolutionary moments (See, e.g.;(Skocpol); (Wootton); (Wolin); (Davidson), (Comninel 153); (Nearing); (Kautsky); (Marx); (Kelly).  The lived experience of a revolution is a life-changing process for the people who have inserted themselves into the political community.  Moreover, in the case of a social revolution this lived experience has an even greater impact on the people since they integrate themselves into, and hold the balance of power within, any given political community . |||Bibliography||Comninel, George C.

Increasing significance of coal extraction in Soma for the Turkish economy from the mid-2000s onwards to overcome the over-use of imported energy in electricity production and of encouraging the use of domestic coal coincided with the dispossession of the petty commodity producers in agriculture-especially of tobacco producers. In this paper, the analysis of the impact of extractive investments in Soma is made with reference to three interrelated discussions: (i) labour supply in the coal pits in Soma with reference to the processes of dispossession and proletarianization of the agricultural petty commodity producers (ii) transformation of sexual division of labour in the basin in productive and reproductive work towards feminization of agricultural work and intensification of women's reproductive work (iii) labour containment strategies in the basin.

"2019-11-25 16:55:19",Communication,"Ecuador against the 'neoliberal pact': Protest, Anti-colonial politics and Popular blocs formation.","On the night of Sunday, October 13, 2019, Ecuador saw the broadcast of the negotiation between the political forces that confronted each other during 11 days of a national strike. The national strike started with mobilization of indigenous organizations from rural areas to Quito (capital of Ecuador) demanding the repeal of Decree 883 (labeled by social actors as the """"neoliberal economic package""""). Decree 883 contained the elimination of subsidies for common-use fuels, which would have a direct impact on daily consumption prices, especially food and transportation.|The days of protest against the neo-liberal adjustment promoted by the Government of Lenin Moreno and the International Monetary Fund led the Government towards the activation of a series of discursive mechanisms to delegitimize mobilizations. The protest was described by government actors as a series of 'vandalism actions' within a destabilization plan promoted by Rafael Correa (former president of Ecuador), Nicolás Maduro (president of Venezuela), former members of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), the Latin King (a juvenile association), and Venezuelan foreigners and Cubans. Far from what the Ecuadorian Government declared, the national strike was a protest led by the Indigenous Movement against U.S. neo-colonialism and the local elite's economic agenda. |This presentation addresses how social protest in October 2019 national strike, although it demanded the repeal of Decree 883, it was a platform for the construction of a social-popular bloc against the neoliberal pact.  I name as """"neoliberal pact"""" the bloc made up of the two most important right-wing political parties in Ecuador: the Christian Social Party -(Partido Social Cristiano- PSC) chaired by the former mayor of Guayaquil, Jaime Nebot, and the  """"Creating Opportunities Movement"""" (""""Movimiento Creando Oportunidades"""" -CREO) of the banker Guillermo Lasso. The Business Chambers of Quito and Guayaquil, the Chamber of Industries of Ecuador, the large private media, and the Presidency of the Republic are the other members of the neoliberal pact.  |On the other hand, the social and popular bloc is integrated by the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), the Unitary Front of Workers (FUT), student organizations grouped in the National Front of Students, and the Feminist Front of Ecuador. This social-popular bloc also integrated different civil society organizations and middle-class sectors.|In this regard, this presentation examines the popular bloc's insistence in the anti-neoliberal character of the protest, and not exclusively as demands of the indigenous movement. Struggles for effective citizenship then appear as a dynamic construction in which the established identification categories are transgressed, and the political struggle is condensed. However, such possibilities for political articulation among different popular actors are linked to the anti-oligarchic republicanism in the democratic tradition of Ecuadorian politics. Therefore,  against racist and colonial representations of indigenous leaders, the popular block enacted the dynamic nature of citizenship through the open struggle for its materialization: its translation into economic, social, and political equality, disputing the disposition of legal institution and power structures. |However, to date, the possibility that the popular bloc is consolidated as an alternative political force for state control remains to be seen.",English,No,"Anti-Imperialism in a Tempest-Tossed World",Models,1,"Jorge Daniel",Vasquez,He/him/his,jdvasquez@flacso.edu.ec,"Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador","Jorge Daniel Vasquez teaches sociology at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador.

Now its proponents must flesh out the details. We need to publicly debate different visions of the GND, think strategically about how to make the GND a reality and ensure it is truly just and transformative.|We argue that ecological economists can play a leading role in this revolutionary task. Yet ecological economists have only begun to engage with the GND, emphasizing how it might impede or enable a downscaling of wealthy countries' economies and an associated downscaling of emissions and exploitation. While making the GND compatible with degrowth is crucial, ecological economists have much more to offer to the design of such a transformative agenda.|To this end, this roundtable aims to inform the GND through the lens of ecological economics, further shaped by collective critique, support, and visioning. The roundtable will feature a series of short presentations followed by group discussion. Several key aspects of ecological economics will guide this discussion to enrich understandings around the GND, including a social-ecological perspective, thinking beyond growth, understanding complexity and scale, an emphasis on equity among people and justice beyond humans, and an intentionally political framing. This session is a call for ecological economists to collaborate with grassroots movements to put forward ideas about a truly transformative and just Green New Deal that bridges political aspirations, justice, and material realities. We therefore invite ecological economists and other radical thinkers to join this conversation and bring their expertise to bear on the ideas around the GND.|The roundtable builds from a recent gathering in Montreal at the Anthropocene to the Ecozoic Symposium. Following a series of position papers addressing different aspects of a Green New Deal for an Ecological Economy, students and colleagues of the Economics for the Anthropocene and Leadership for the Ecozoic programs utilized their diverse perspectives and fields to craft a manifesto for the realization of their utopia: An Ecozoic New Deal. The Ecozoic New Deal draws on aspects of ecological economics inspired by degrowth, environmental justice, and visionary ideas about societies radically different than our own to imagine a path towards true transformation.

"2019-11-25 17:44:29",Communication,"Decolonial Futures: Indigenous Survivance in the End of Times ","In 2018, scientists from The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claimed that humans must take unprecedented steps to radically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. The impact of human-caused climate change is already being felt globally, with devastating wildfires, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, mass species extinction, and abnormal weather events, making world annihilation seem more likely than ever before. Given this situation, it is perhaps unsurprising that post-apocalyptic fiction has grown in popularity, with the publication of climate fiction or cli-fi, as it is popularly referred to, steadily rising since the turn of the millennium. Many of these post-apocalyptic novels are ultimately cynical about a politics of change or liberation - often exposing a future defined by grim determinism and reinforcing pre- set structures of oppression. In particular, post-apocalyptic narratives written and propagated by white men, frequently depict the end of our current system purely as an entropic disruption of what they consider to be progress. By contrast, Waubgeshig Rice's 2018 novel, Moon of the Crusted Snow, reverses the polarity of those discussions by framing the apocalypse as a politically mobilizing and agency-creating mechanism. In Rice's novel, settler Canadian communities struggle to survive the unprecedented weather conditions because of their reliance on modern technology. Indigenous communities; however, who have already experienced many apocalyptic events since the colonization of Canada began in the late fifteenth century, are represented as being better suited to survive and prosper in a changing world. My paper argues that Rice's novel provides a scenario in which the traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples becomes a tool for survivance, a term used by Anishinaabe cultural theorist Gerald Vizenor to describe an active and thriving sense of presence, thus allowing First-Nations communities to take full advantage of the utopian possibility of beginning again.",English,No,"Decolonizing Knowledge",Models,1,Kirsten,Bussiere,she/her,kbuss013@uottawa.ca,"University of Ottawa","Kirsten Bussière is a PhD student in English Literature at the University of Ottawa in Canada's capital city.

"2019-11-25 17:57:57",Communication,"Race and Class - Dialectical Perspectives","In this paper, I want to analyze and comment on how the intersectional connection between race and class was framed by a few influential writers in the 1940-70s who relied on Hegelian dialectics. Frantz Fanon, CLR James, and Raya Dunayevskaya each in their own way found great inspiration for their writings on race and class in Hegel's work, primarily in 'Phenomenology of the Spirit' (1806), in particular in the section on the master and the slave, and in 'Science of Logic' (1812). But at the same time as they were inspired by aspects of Hegel's work, these thinkers also had criticism of it. ||What makes their respective writings interesting for today is especially how they framed the anti-racist struggle as central to the struggle to overcome capitalism. They saw it as reason for revolution. And more, by drawing on Hegel, Fanon and Dunayevskaya discussed the affirmative aspect of negating a determined object. With other words, they emphasized the negation of the negation as the creating and moving principle that forms the base for a new beginning, a new society. ||My paper thus aims to investigate whether we can employ these sources as resources for working out a theory of liberation that fits the challenges of today. In this sense, this exercise ties into a bigger project of rediscovering and critically evaluating Hegelian dialectics by investigating how the dialectical analysis can be, and has been, used to understand the intersection between race and class in contemporary society.

Tensions within the Plurinational Project in Ecuador (2008-2019)","The analysis of gender-based violence against women (GBV/VAW) acquires complex nuances in contexts where the collective right of indigenous communities to exercise their legal systems (customary law), gave rise to regimes of legal pluralism. Within the indigenous communities, various manifestations of gender violence frequently cause the violation of women´s human rights. This situation complicates the relations between the indigenous communities and a State that has been historically built from the paradigm of uniform Nation-State without transcending these limits in practice.|The problem is commonly assumed, from different actors, as a contrast between individual and collective rights; between modernity and tradition. Although indigenous women have defended indigenous jurisdiction to resolve cases of violence, they have raised the need to transform patriarchal practices that bias justice enactments. On the other hand, the State, from a human rights perspective, rooted in the International Law must prevent human rights violations derived from gender violence within the indigenous communities.|This presentation addresses this juncture. I analyze the tensions between legal pluralism -as a regime that frameworks the implementation of the collective right to exercise their own systems of law, constitutionally recognized to indigenous peoples- and the judicial interventions of the Ecuadorian State regarding cases of violence against indigenous women. Based on the exploration of the identified problem, I analyze the fundaments for guaranteeing indigenous women's human rights in cases of gender violence, within the framework of emancipatory legal pluralism. Finally, I show how these processes put into practice the principles of intercultural justice for cases that are known by the Ordinary Justice but where the actors are indigenous people.

Labour and social movement debates frequently prioritize cases of spectacular mobilization or successful strategic models which can be abstracted and diffused across left movements around the globe (Kenny 2018). By contrast this paper argues that Social Reproduction Theory and Analysis (SRT) provides theoretical tools to situate the experiences of the labouring classes and struggles against both exploitation and oppression, no matter where they take place, arguing that these struggles are profoundly intertwined. SRT recovers class by building up from the material, everyday experience of working-class life to generate understandings of struggle within the capitalist totality in which difference within class is constitutive of the class itself.

This paper will argue that this view is mistaken. It is true that the Russian empire of the revolutionary period was only lightly urbanized, its three major cities - St. Petersburg, Moscow and Kiev - surrounded by tens of millions of agrarian peasants. However, the term """"petit bourgeois"""" in historical materialism has a precise meaning, referencing """"small capitalists"""" who are motivated by production for the market and capital accumulation. By contrast, the agrarian economy in much of Russia was organized, not on the market, but on subsistence. There were some, particularly in Ukraine, who fitted the petit-bourgeois definition - peasants organized in family farms, producing for the market. But in Russia proper, the vast majority of peasants were organized in the """"commune"""", a semi-feudal patriarchal institution which controlled land distribution, and was relatively immune to any pressures toward capital accumulation. This mistake in theory was of little consequence when the left was isolated and small. But when the left took power, after 1917, mistaken theory led to catastrophic practice -during the """"War Communism"""" years of 1918 to 1921, and the terrible """"war on the kulaks"""" of the 1930s which killed millions, and set back the agrarian economy for decades.

Insofar as the Left continues to focus on models and strategies whose scope remains internal to building a hegemonic Leftist block it will ignore, at the Left's own peril, the external adversity imposed by a status quo that refuses Leftist alternatives by all means necessary -- immoral or exorbitant means that the Left cannot always engage and address. It is high time that the Left articulates a theory of struggle that lends itself to battling the necessities of the Friend-Enemy dichotomy as well as to building utopias. In the final analysis, no egalitarian hypothesis is a match for the cunning that exploits egalitarianism's weaknesses in order to mobilize them against utopianism. A counter-counterrevolutionary politics contends with Rightwing pushback but does not play by its rules.||To this end, I argue that the international Left requires a proactive politics that is capable of anticipating and counteracting neoliberalism's ruthless domination and elimination of Leftist alternatives. Against a defensive ethos of resistance that predominates Leftist politics, I advance prescriptive strategies for prefiguring and disarming contentious dynamics in which Leftist actors struggle against dominant political orders. The central premise of such a project is theorizing a truly Leftist realpolitik that, while effective, does not respond to Rightwing violence and cunning in kind. I rework four areas of Leftist theory in international strategy, propaganda, solidarity, and logistics for this purpose. I begin with the general outlines of what has been an effective counter-revolutionary strategy for the capitalist status quo over the last century, by drawing on works in the Gramscian school of international relations.

Particularly sharp debates on the question of state power have riven a Marxist left that was until quite recently united in its opposition to working with bourgeois political parties. But it is the position of the Specter editorial board that these debates have assumed an unfortunate form. On one side, more traditional Marxists have assimilated an emergent electoralist tendency to the reformism of old, failing to appreciate what is novel about these strategic interventions. On the other, democratic socialists have reduced skeptics of their approach to dogmatists with but a single tool in their box: insurrection.| |What is clear from an initial round of debates is that both sides, insofar as its protagonists have coalesced into two broadly defined camps, agree that the working class (and socialists) can and should intervene in bourgeois politics. Where they differ is on the question of how to intervene. Should this intervention play out on a terrain whose parameters are defined by the capitalist state? Or should we think of this governmental arena as a space in which to intervene, but without yielding to its internal conception of what constitutes the political?| |On this panel, we will feature a range of speakers interrogating the question of what it means for socialists to take advantage of this new range of opportunities without capitulating to the state's own limited definition of legitimate politics. We develop strategic interventions that chart the course between the Scylla of abstentionism and the Charibdys of liquidationism. What principles should remain non-negotiable, and conversely, how can we maintain class independence without falling prey to dogmatism?| |Zachary Levenson will frame these debates by laying out the terrain, providing an overview of the first round of state debates in the 1970s and explaining the limits of the current round.

In order to detain the industrial development in progress, the canuts understood that it was not enough to propose means to maintain their economic organization, but that they had to draw a political system that would ensure it. Therefore, the potentiality of the Revolts des Canuts should be regarded not only by its strength to fight oppression but also by its vigor to create bases for a new social order.| Rethinking 21st Century's fashion industry through the lens of the Revolts des Canuts can give us guidelines to new forms of production and consumption. It is known that fashion is an ever-growing industry, one that overcomes older forms of production in order to accommodate massive industrial plants, specially in peripheric economies. So how can we rethink this current arrangement through the economic system proposed by the canuts, one that preached the abolition of the proletariat through the establishment of associations and the development of attractive work through the dissolution of the industrial system? |This paper also aims to analyze how the canuts' historical experience shows that transforming the mode of production it is not only impracticable but impossible without a change in the political system. In the case of the canuts, this meant to search in Saint-Simon's and Fourier's writings for models and ideas to constitute a new form of society. In our turn, we must ask what role these utopian thinkers can play today in reimagining the integration between the economic and the political system, and between work and life itself. |Following Walter Benjamin's track left by his Concepts of History, this means that we must look out for the dialectical interactions between the old and the new, which can produce a disruption in the fabric of history through the recovery and readjustment of what was once lost in the past to the present. |||",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Models,1,Giulia,Falcone,she/her,giulia.falcone@usp.br,"University of São Paulo","Giulia Falcone has a Bachelor's Degree in History from Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas of Universidade de São Paulo (FFLCH-USP) in Brazil and is a master's student of the Social History program by the same institution.

His death following this gruesome attack is one in an alarmingly long list of crimes that have been committed in the name of the cow in the last few years. Since then, in India's so-called """"cow belt"""" i.e. many states across north and west India, the Indian cow's rights have gained precedence over the human rights of Indians as lynch mobs attack and intercept any movement of cows and buffaloes, then selectively attack only Muslims, and in a few instances, Dalits-killing or grievously injuring them.  While such heinous acts are perpetrated, and often documented on social media, law enforcers look on. In a hideous twist to this brutal tale, the victims are arrested while the perpetrators are either let off, or are feebly charged as """"unknown persons"""". In some particularly egregious instances, the perpetrators in these lynch mobs have been publicly venerated as heroes and martyrs in their villages. ||Public response to these acts of spectacular violence has been rather muted, save a few counter-protests.  Even when voices are raised, they are drowned out by the deafening official silence on the one hand, and sometimes, blatant endorsement of these actions on the other. This silence breeds an atmosphere of impunity and collective gratitude for the actions of the gau rakshaks, helped in no small part by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shifting rhetoric on whether these gau rakshaks are """"keepers of culture"""" or criminals.  Additionally, the Bhartiya Janata Party's (BJP) return to power with a thumping majority speaks volumes of a deep social churning that shaped the people's mandate in 2019. ||Given that these acts of spectacular violence have steadily become a part of the 'new normal' in Narendra Modi's India, in this paper, I explore how the nexus between the government officials, majoritarian party structures allows sectarian actors like the police and the gau rakshaks to re-interpret Article 48 (a Directive in the Indian Constitution that supports a prohibition against cattle slaughter without overtly imposing it) to legitimise the violent logic of cow vigilantism in the present. I argue that cow vigilantes invert many environmental rights and animal rights discourses to suit their exclusivist Hindu nationalist philosophies, allowing the figure of the """"sacred cow"""" to acquire new symbolic purchase in the everyday national imaginary, while simultaneously devaluing, and endangering the lives of Muslim and Dalit cattle traders and tanners. In this discussion, I hope to productively engage with the limits of concept of utopias, situating it in a context of rising Hindu fundamentalism in everyday life and politics in contemporary India. | |------------||References: |Suhasini Raj, """"Hindu Cow Vigilantes in Rajasthan, India, Beat Muslim to Death"""", The New York Times, April 5, 2017.

These papers characterize the movement as a direct affront to the neoliberal policies that have been practiced in Chile in the last three decades. That the Chilean uprisings are seemingly inclusive of and participated in by Chileans from the different strata that neoliberalism has created indicates a radical shift in the model of political struggle. That is, a shift from the postmodern conception of struggle whose success is limited to """"partial emancipation"""" toward a universal model of politics capable of achieving Total Emancipation. ",English,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,3,Mahdi,Ghanbari,m.ghanbari.de@gmail.com,"Beyond Postmodernism: the Revival of a Politics of Total Emancipation","One of the fundamental assumptions of Marxist social theory both in the analysis of capitalism and in creating a radical social change is the centrality of the working-class.  Marxism justifies this principle through the fact that it is the workers' labor that produces value in a capitalistic system and therefore they are the only social force to create an egalitarian mode of production. However, as Ernesto Laclau, the Argentine political theorists and the inventor of Post-Marxism suggests with the advent of the so-called """"golden age of capitalism,"""" which is marked by the unprecedented expansion of global economy after WWII and the decline of working-class this essential assumption of Marxism seemed to be undermined.

The only true form of emancipation, then, is """"partial emancipation"""" of the """"minorities."""" As opposed to this view, I will argue that the recent protests in Chile have the characteristics of a mass movement that has the potentials for a radical transformation of the very structure of capitalistic mode of production.

Lessons from Chile","In Chile, decades of ongoing social movements have recently galvanized in large scale protests against neo-liberalism and the social inequality it creates. Latin American scholarship in general offers rigorous analysis of capitalist systems in relation to social movements, and thus offers a conceptual framework that may strengthen analysis in North American scholarship. One particular theoretical framework is Latin American feminist scholarship. Feminist scholarship, and the activism of certain women's groups in Chile is in direct theoretical and practical conflict with neoliberalism values that currently inform Chile's economy and society. Neoliberalism emphasizes a split between the private and the public and a rampant individualism that can only exacerbate and economically stratify differences already based on social factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender. Feminist values in Latin American scholarship place emphasis on breaking down the difference between the self and the other and bringing together the public and private to have women fill public spaces and make themselves heard, connecting the individual to the wider public sphere. The feminist movement in Chile at its core has the potential for anti-neoliberal, anti-hegemonic and decolonial outcomes. One example of this was the large-scale student protests against sexual harassment and violence against women in 2018, which was framed as a struggle against neoliberalism. Others are the Mapuche indigenous women and pobladoras who continue to fight for the rights that are only afforded to some women by drawing attention to how other women are excluded from these rights because of ethnicity. Yet another example are graffiteras, female street art collectives that thrive on freedom of expression in the streets of Chile. Graffiteras engage critically with themes of resistance and anti-neoliberalism, and the practice of their art itself defies the privatization of goods that neoliberalism manifests. Through a study of these micro-level activist groups, this paper will examine how individual and group actions against social inequality contribute to the larger anti-hegemonic discourses that have led to the protests unfolding in Chile today.

The demonstrations had initially been in response to a subway fair increase of 0.30 pesos (approx. $0.05 CA) but soon became the voice of a series of social discontents and injustices such as intolerable inequality, the rising cost of living, poor work conditions, low wages, miserable pensions, as well as the inadequate cost and quality of education, public health, and other public utilities. The population's discontents were soon condensed and translated into two particularly powerful demands: Piñera's resignation and the establishment of a new constitution. What we are seeing in the Chilean protests is a direct attack and rejection of the neoliberal policies that have mediated the Chilean state's relation to its own citizens since Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, as well as the nation's place in the global community. In this paper I will discuss the protests' demands and strategies, highlighting their utopic promises and possible shortcomings. In the words of Alain Badiou, these demonstrations can be said to be ushering a reopening of history grounded in an explicit and concerted rejection of neoliberalism itself; an attack so direct and so powerful that in the face of its inability to re-frame the movement as a people's """"desire for the West,"""" North American mainstream media has been mostly silent.

Advocates of democratic socialism such as Vivek Chibber and Bhaskar Sunkara mobilize various conceptions of universal norms in their articulations of socialist politics, which are tied to an unreconstructed notion of individuality. More specifically, in spite of the laudable motivations of these interventions, this theoretical dependence on the notions of universal individual interests undermines the efforts of these critics to separate both social democratic politics and historical materialism from liberal traditions. A core tenet of socialism is the constitution of the individual in and through society; conceptualizing the notion of universality through formally universalizable interests undermines this commitment by either conceptualizing those interests in terms of the forms of subjectivity characteristic of capitalist society or by upholding a false distinction between universal and culturally-specific political aims. Consequently, these theorists either underplay the extent to which the specific articulation of the interests of political actors is constituted through their historico-cultural contexts or overstate the importance of purportedly universal moral principles for political agents. This leads these theorists to adopt decontextualized analyses of our capitalist past and proscriptions for the socialist future. The three two papers of this panel will interrogate problems attendant to this conceptualization of universality and individuality from the perspectives of environmental and decolonial politics.

Instead, ecosocialists argue for a principled recognition that we cannot obtain planetary justice and sustainability without a deeper reckoning with our imperial past and present. This framing helps to upset the debate around reparations on the left, which often pits class-reductionist socialists (who simplistically argue that if we achieve genuine equality, reparations are irrelevant and counterproductive) against left liberals like Ta-Nehisi Coates, who argue for reparations without broader social transformation. What democratic ecosocialism argues is that both positions are, in fact, impossible; equality is not achievable without a fuller reckoning with past injustices, while genuine restitution of injustice cannot be made without dismantling the system that produced it. Further, the ecosocialist position demonstrates the hidden affinity of liberalism and class-reductionist socialism in their formal conception of universality, which ecosocialism replaces with a more historically rich and realistic account.|",English,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,Dan,Boscov-Ellen,,dan.boscovellen@gmail.com,"The New School for Social Research",,,,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nature or Second Nature: Culture and Class Struggle in Historical Materialism","Joshua Nicholas Pineda's paper critiques Vivek Chibber's notion emancipatory universalism (or, as he terms it """"the other univeralism"""") articulated in his Post-Colonialism and the Specter of Capital. Chibber argues that analysts have to assume a """"basic human need for individual well-being"""" - that is, a universal human nature - in order to point to the cross-cultural similarities in the development of European and Colonial emancipatory movements. While this paper agrees that this universal need exists, this thin notion of human nature can be used to explain virtually any action of any human agent; consequently, the explanatory value of universal human nature is negligible, particularly given the demand to explain the politically relevant specificities of any historical event. Thus, this paper argues both that Chibber's analytical framework suffers from the uncritical acceptance of the opposition between nature and culture Chibber denies, and that it can be remedied by both the joint appeal to the weak naturalism philosophically advocated by John McDowell and a class struggle model of historical explanation.

In The Socialist Manifesto, for instance, Bhaskar Sunkara offer a morality-centric definition by which merely asserting the moral worth of every person is sufficient for socialist commitments. Yet, from Kant onwards versions of such a definition have been used to bolster capitalist ideologies. Worse, using the individual and their status as morally to center socialist commitments makes the socialist horizon into a realization rather than transformation of individuated bourgeois powers. Without any transformation in our capacities, such views simply hold that socialists are committed to helping each individual reach their potentials. In such a view, potentials neither require and are not to be subject to radical transformation. Socialism therefore appears as unrestrained individuality, and the scope and powers of the individuality capital leaves us with are construed as the upper limit of our potentials. Questions like whether the wage-relation can itself be moral are left out, while what the wage relation and other forms of social violence does to individuality itself is inconceivable. This approach ends up construing socialism's horizon as an indefinite extensions of the liberal same. At once, focusing too much on individual moral worth ignores how we are socially formed, and how our potentials both can and need to be socially transformed for full liberation. |",English,"Fighting All Oppression",Models,1,Aaron,Jaffe,,aarond.jaffe@gmail.com,"The Juilliard School",,,,"Prefer not to say",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aarond.jaffe@gmail.com,"Aaron Jaffe","One of our proposed panelists - Dan Boscov-Ellen - would only be available to present on the Thursday or Friday of the conference.

"2019-11-25 23:58:58",Communication,"On Petty Emperors and Commoning in Utopian Speculative Fiction","What is most dangerous to a fledgling utopian project? While external pressures and attacks present as monumentally threatening, it is often the petty emperor who is fatal to a perfectly good utopia. Toxic dysfunction, vindictive sabotage, and egoist power plays wait to manifest like sanctimonious poltergeists. The success or failure of relationships and associations, communities and movements, rests not only on the efficacy of organization or technical engineering but on the quality and functionality of the interpersonal. Petty emperors, as they appear in the utopian novels of Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed and Cory Doctorow's Walkaway, draw our attention to the consequent erosion of the social fabric, and impress the magnitude of the need for consideration of the relational in utopian thinking.||The viability of the techno-utopia, and its prognostications of the liberating potential of automation (most recently envisaged as fully automated luxury communism), is challenged by utopian narratives that emphasize relationality. In Re-Enchanting the World: Feminism and the Politics of the Commons, Silvia Federici notes that approaches that laud automation obscure the commons as a network of social relations: as the act of commoning. The reproductive commons, of everyday life and reproductive labour, makes it clear that care work is not easily automated because it is primarily relational. Similarly, in Communal Luxury: The Political Imaginary of the Paris Commune, Kristin Ross describes a dialectical relationship between the imaginary and the concrete instantiation or lived experience, where the former does not always precede the latter. Her idea of communal luxury is also relational, and incorporates an aesthetic dimension. Both Federici and Ross point to the obstacle of the petty tyrant. Ross mentions the """"little emperor"""" when discussing Reclus' argument for voluntary federalism and the freedom of the individual as the foundation for solidarity. Federici recounts histories of enclosures, and warns against gated commons and gatekeeping within the commons.||Utopian speculative fiction allows us not only to project societal constructions, but deeply personalizes our awareness of relational aspects through the interactions of characters. Le Guin's utopian anarchism in The Dispossessed does attend to reproductive labour, but her imagined world is one of scarcity, and lacks the aesthetic dimension of Ross' communal luxury. The petty emperor dynamic is central to the novel: the ambiguity of Le Guin's utopia rests, in large part, on resolving the conflicts instigated by jockeying for power. Doctorow also wrestles with reproductive labour in his decentralized walkaway communities, but tries to conceive of how this might be compatible with automation rather than at odds with it. Like Le Guin, he highlights the probability of power struggles and attempts at gatekeeping. Their strategies for contending with the petty emperor inform our utopian imaginary, enabling us to prepare for and respond to expected interpersonal discord.|||",English,No,"An Economy in the Hands of Everyone",Strategies,1,Morgan,Young,She/her,morgany@sfu.ca,"Simon Fraser University, Department of Humanities","Morgan Young has an interdisciplinary background, mostly in music, anthropology, and philosophy.

What are the systems requirements for a livable future?|2.

This paper argues that Drawdown by Paul Hawken offers the propensity to form a solution to global climate change superior to the congressionally resolved Green New Deal (GND), and in fact contains the seeds of a Drawdown New Deal (DND). The DND that is suggested by this paper will drawdown 630 gigatons of CO2EQ at a money measured cost (mmc) of zero, while the lowest known extant GND cost estimate will drawdown less than 172 Gigatons of CO2EQ at a mmc of 7.6 trillion dollars. What is also largely absent from the mainstream discourse is the huge environmental damage that is being done to the Earth including and outside of what may be global climate change, per se. To drawdown global climate change alone and stop all non-renewable resource use, it is vital to understand that it is necessary to dramatically reduce material consumption and to do this, to significantly change cultural norms. The environmental damage attributed to Neoliberal economic policies comes from the consumption it has allowed, not the capital accumulation it has entailed. Profits are not the problem, overpopulation is. It is for this reason that the first DND solution, Educating Girls and Family Planning will reduce over thirty years more than five-eighths of the CO2EQ that zero carbon emissions in the United States would reduce over the same time period-at a cost of less than one-third of a what a recent U.S. presidential candidate pledged to spend on green energy subsidies alone. In short, the culprit is patriarchy, not neoliberalism, per se. This paper will go on to argue that the rejection of an unsustainable system in which command over consumption (money) is used to incentivize greening and other socially necessary production, and the acceptance of a sustainable system in which spiritual goods are the primary means of consumption beyond subsistence, will heal the Earth, allow for longer human existence upon it and create a more joyful one as well.

However, integration of ecological restoration with emergent social phenomena could bring this practice to its highest potential as a means of healing the biosphere and as a means of psychological and societal healing. To achieve this reimagined potential requires deep collaboration between scientists, social changemakers, businesspeople, and native peoples. This profound re-networking could be designed in a way that also lifts ecological restoration to its highest potential as a means of crafting a livelihood. A useful leverage point in this pursuit may be the reorientation of ecological restoration around the goal of restoring harmonious and regenerative use of the land and sea.

The authors take this as being """"emblematic of"""" the """"formalized modes of reasoning"""" which embodies """"dichotomies such as culture/politics, state/society and formal/informal, refracting the notion of authoritarian neoliberalism through narrow prisms"""" and which those who have raised the questions allegedly subscribe to (2018, p.5).|This paper will argue that the reasons for the absence of Stuart Hall in those questions might have some deeper roots which cannot be blamed entirely on the audience. A careful reading of the texts by Hall which Bruff and Tansel utilize would show that Hall is not simply talking about Thatcherism and authoritarian populism but also criticizing the Left for its inability to pose an effective challenge. In this respect, it is crucial that Hall does not limit himself to the critique of the Labour Party of his time but also criticizes the economism of the orthodox Marxists. This crucial aspect of Hall's oeuvre is unfortunately missing in the """"authoritarian neoliberalism"""" literature. Given the importance of challenging Marxist orthodoxy for Poulantzas too, this absence is even more problematic.|Matthew DJ Ryan rightly credits Bruff and those who follow him for bringing to our attention the """"strengthening-weakening dynamic"""" Poulantzas discerned in the case of authoritarian statism (2018, p.16-18). And this begs the question then why the Left so far has been largely unsuccessful in terms of taking advantage of this weakening of the authoritarian states. Moreover, if there is really a qualitative change in the neoliberalism we are seeing after 2007-2008 crisis as Bruff (2014) suggests, this cannot be thought separately from the balance of class forces. For example, Poulantzas argued that the """"rise of fascism corresponds to an ideological crisis of the working class, and to a significant crisis of the revolutionary organizations"""" (1974, p.143). This is not to suggest that the current conjuncture is the same with fascism. However, as it currently stands, the """"authoritarian neoliberalism"""" literature looks largely silent over the question of the mistakes of the Left which make the conjuncture of these authoritarian practices possible and it would greatly benefit from a rereading of Hall and Poulantzas -their debt to Gramsci being already well-known- with this question in the mind.|As Zachary Levenson and Teresa Kalisz's recent intervention to the state theory debate which is taking place on Verso Books' blog has shown in the case of only one example, there are significant problems with the adaptations of Poulantzas' work into the English-speaking contexts. Welcoming the increased interest in Poulantzas' work as the idea of """"democratic socialism"""" gains currency and deeming his work essential to orienting ourselves in the current and future conjunctures, this paper wishes to join, continue and expand the challenge Levenson and Kalisz posed to the problematic adaptations of Poulantzas' work.|",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,"Ali Behran",Ozcelik,He/him,behran1@yahoo.com,"Withdrawn until defense at York University, so at the moment I consider myself unaffiliated.","Ali Behran Ozcelik is a doctoral candidate at York University's Graduate Programme in Social & Political Thought and specializes on the theories of the state.",,,Male,"Person of color",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,behran1@yahoo.com,"Ali Behran Ozcelik",,"Chrome 78.0.3904.108 / Windows",199.212.65.76,558998206,"43.769401550293, -79.49210357666"

Today, however, the political discontent that was a catalyst for radical thought has taken a counter-productive and reactionary turn. Indeed, the situation in the academy has not only turned away from a progressive political agenda, it has developed into an epidemic of suspicion that is eating whatever remains of the academic left alive. In the belief that the academy has a role to play in solving the political problems that plague our societies, this paper analyses the causes of its current state. ||In 2014 Rita Felski published a book that has divided the academy, The Limits of Critique. She argued that the academy ought to turn away from criticism and pursue other types of scholarship. I disagree completely. And yet, she put her finger on something: a pervasive mood of grand-standing, moral signaling, and calling-out, that passes itself off as radical politics, and which is, moreover, suffocating whatever the humanities are capable of with respect to political thought and engagement. ||This paper begins from the mood Felski identifies, but provides an alternative, Marxist and psychoanalytical account of its causes and manifestation. In brief, it argues that it is the very retreat of the left from economic and properly political concerns, indeed the result of the de-politicization of the economic base, that has pushed the political discontent of the academy into a logic of suspicion, which is, moreover, radically reactionary. This retreat of the left from economic concerns, and in the absence of positive moral values, has turned the political discontent of the academic left into a logic homologous to what Hegel identified with the Reign of Terror, and distorted what could otherwise be political engagement into a liberalism passing itself of as radical thought, all the while abolishing the very possibility of solidarity, class-struggle, and large political-economic projects. |",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Models,1,Srdjan,Cvjeticanin,,srdjan@umich.edu,"University of Michigan, PhD Student ","PhD Student in Comparative Literature, at the University of Michigan, studying political romanticism in Britain and America.

"2019-11-26 10:49:31",Communication,"'Towards more A-partisan Collective Action? Experiences from the Gilets Jaunes movement in the South of France'","This paper is based on semi-structured interviews and participatory research on events in France since 17 November 2018 and the Gilets Jaunes movement. Through participation in local organising groups and demonstrations in the South East of France, in the region of Avignon, and in reaction to leftwing commentary very largely emanating from Paris, the paper discusses the original elements of the movement and how it challenges Marxist theory and organising. The movement is particularly helpful to understand new forms of struggle and new political formations of subjectivities amidst a political landscape that increasingly escapes traditional binaries and strategies. The 'apartisan' stance of the movement is the focus of this paper, which asks whether it constitutes more of a challenge or an opportunity for the movement. This stance should be understood alongside the rejection of establishment intellectual ideas and technologies, the rejection of trade unions, the confrontation with police violence, the rejection of leadership, the support of the majority of the French population several months into what became a large scale social conflict, and the rising acknowledgement of a new type of poverty and precariousness in France, especially in its more rural and small urban provinces. These all raise important questions and analyses for Marxist theory and organising on social movements and political subjectivities. ||I am happy to present this in French or in English.||",Français,No,"Fighting All Oppression",Strategies,1,Maia,Pal,she/her,mpal@brookes.ac.uk,"Editorial board of Historical Materialism",,,,Female,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mpal@brookes.ac.uk,"Maia Pal",,"Chrome 78.0.3904.108 / Windows",161.73.120.89,559102755,"51.75, -1.25"

Addressing such disunity and fragmentation opens the way to new bases for democratic participation across the left. The papers explore methods and practices for both sustained, unified diversity with anti-capitalist movements from the local to the global.

",English,No,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,3,Olive,Mckeon,olivemckeon@cca.edu,"Marxist societal development from conversation to community: the role of group dynamics ","Karl Marx wrote in 1844 """"Company, association, and conversation, which again has society (with one another) as its end, are enough for them; the brotherhood of man is no mere phrase with them, but a fact of life, and the nobility of man shines upon us from their work-hardened bodies.""""   Marx, as I will argue, was the seminal thinker for this form of engaged group interaction that today is called group dynamics, a reflective meeting of minds that through a mutual dialectical process study their own ideation and that of others.  A learned behavior of listening and cooperating is stimulated by that.  Skills of empathy, listening, and the manner of dialectical dialogue-the core of what Marx saw as the societal dialectic--are learned to carry forward into any other association with others one engages in.  This article tracks Marx's own phenomenological focus upon how concepts must grow from a wealth of engaged ordinary thought and speech, and in that provides the foundation for later Marxists who generated their Marxist efforts of changing the social structure of society upon what came to be called 'group dynamics'.  Max Adler, Lucien Goldmann, and Kurt Lewin were all Social-Democrats whose legacy is still the core of what Marx understood as seminal to cultural change.  The group dynamics method of Kurt Lewin is carefully assessed, countering the criticism of other Marxists-who did not see the significance of interpersonal conversation-such as Jean Paul Sartre.",English,"Rethinking Democracy and Power",Strategies,1,"Mark E.

Blum is professor of history at the University of Louisville.",,,Male,,,,,,,,,,,,"Group Relations for the Left: Applications of the Tavistock Method for the Marxist Tradition","The history of Marxism is nearly synonymous with splits, factionalism, and divisiveness. While Marxists often espouse the principles of solidarity and mutual aid, the left has been no stranger to fierce in-fighting and deep rifts between different tendencies. There are, of course, many good reasons for Marxists to fight with each other, as theoretical and strategic debates have significant implications for understanding the past and shaping the future. While one can understand these splits by tracking key differences in the interpretations of capitalism and approaches to revolutionary organizing, there may be another way to read factionalism on the left, namely through the psychoanalysis of groups. Emerging out of the work of Melanie Klein and Wilfred Bion, the field of group relations has developed a psychoanalytic framework to understand the unconscious dynamics that structure groups of all kinds. Bion, in his work with British war veterans after World War II, initiated a methodology known as Tavistock, which centers on the experiential study of what happens in the 'here and now' of group life. Attending to the unconscious structures within groups, the Tavistock method can offer a different and perhaps humbling way to look at the history of struggles on the left. While primarily engaged by psychotherapists, psychiatrists, social workers, and organizational consultants, the field of group relations offers an illuminating perspective on groups that can expand beyond its application within professionalized contexts. I show the relevance for the Marxist tradition of key concepts from group relations: the group-as-a-whole perspective, projective identification, and 'basic assumptions' (dependency, fight/flight, pairing). Through its rigorous examination of group dynamics, Tavistock offers a new way to engage tensions within leftist groups around social difference, leadership, authority, and competition. Marxists have much to gain by interrogating the dynamics that plague groups on the left as well as cultivating the emotional competencies to work with intra- and inter-group conflict.

The Need for Left Unity Is Not Enough","We need collaboration and alliance more than ever across the diversity of the left, in local, national and global perspectives. This holds, I argue, not just to increase the numbers, power and pressure on a still expanding capitalism but because of the nature of capitalism today.  The type of uneven and combined developed of contemporary capitalism calls for an uneven and combined anti-capitalism that can form an arc of anti-capitalism within and across various scales and left approaches from local to global. Self-reflexive transnational collective Anti-capitalist action is the left's historical instinct, running from the 19th century International Working Man's Association (1st International) to early 20th century's Comintern and worldwide syndicalist movements to more recent efforts of global solidarity associated with anti-globalization movements and Samir Amin's call for a new International.  There are various reasons why these past efforts at collaboration failed at building a comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable association or union.  Can Bolshevik-Leninists join with democratic socialists or even community activists who are not avowed Marxist socialists but who nonetheless through their activism are undertaking anti-capitalist action?  Now that the left has a meaningful history behind it, can it recast its assumptions and approach to internationalism and unity more broadly?   History suggests common aims and objects (end of capitalism; worldwide socialist transformation; mass emancipation, defeating fascism; an even fear of defeat) are not enough. This paper considers the obvious paradox in unification: collaborative participation from a distinct positions and standpoints (ideological or organizational) in effect becomes the basis for conflict. It argues that that the left has pursued unification in an under-institutionalized context and treated macro-scale institution- building (e.g., the Internationals) - resting on the assumption of the feasibility and will to sustained collaboration - as the primary and proximate aim of collaboration.  Alternatively, it is suggested, left unity might be better served by building deeply democratic meso-scale institutions - resting on the assumption that conflict and fragmenting tendencies will emerge - such as conflict adjudicating workers tribunals that can operate in synergy with macro-scale institutions and across which group relations and dynamics can be implemented.

Two years later, that confederation is in process of becoming a reality. We hosted our founding Congress with 130+ individuals and 40+ member and partner organizations from Canada, the US, and Mexico in September 2019, and we are now actively building the confederation we talked about at TGC two years ago.

And while national electoral politics tend to be dispiriting, with limited possibility for change, cities and towns are increasingly at the forefront of counter-hegemonic struggles. How can we create people power where we live? A growing worldwide citizen movement is attempting to challenge bureaucratic administrations and replace the politics of fear with neighborhood power, direct democracy, and solidarity. They believe that threats of capitalism, totalitarianism, and climate change require imaginative political resistance. Radical municipalism stems from the belief that we can transform our world's cities through participatory democracy, self-management, and ecology rooted where they live. ||In this panel, several authors of books on radical municipalism open a discussion by presenting their research and political experience on these questions.||Combining political theory, philosophy, history, and intimate narrative, Take the City! (edited by Jasonius T) presents an expansive view of municipalist movements around the world. With over twenty contributors, including David Harvey, this anthology provides crucial insights into the challenges ahead by looking at and beyond municipal electoral politics. Stories of diverse regions and issues illuminate the nuances of municipalist movements of the past and present, providing a roadmap of the fight for our future. From Seattle to Kurdistan, Burlington to Oaxaca, Barcelona to Mississippi, and Vienna to Montreal, contributors carefully consider the intertwined questions concerning current crises in housing, the environment, democracy, and capitalism. ||The book Montreal: A Citizens' Guide to City Politics: Towards an Ecological and Democratic City, (edited by Jason Prince and Eric Shragge) explores the complex issues, contradictions, and opportunities for transforming Montreal. The election of Project Montreal in the Fall of 2017 as the party to control both city council and several key borough councils brought a lot of excitement and raised the possibility of urban transformation for many of us. At the same time, we were struck by the enormous challenges facing the new team. The administration was inheriting a long tradition of municipal governments promoting the city as a site of profitable investment and private economic growth. The municipal governments responded to Issues such as climate change, urban democracy, poverty and racism at best symbolically so long as their policies did not get in the way of investment and growth. Further, cities in Canada have no constitutional status, very little control over resources, are highly dependent on land taxes, and operate with powers delegated from the provincial level and occasionally federal authorities. Thus, the challenges for a 'progressive' and 'green' urban party are structurally limited. Given these limits, how much can a municipal government contribute to fundamental social change? Can capturing the city government make a real difference? Can the city government act to mobilize and engage residents in a wider process of building opposition to corporate power that shapes our society? Will progressive city administrations always have to balance traditional-capitalist forms of economic development with policies that are a little « greener » or « progressive », and act within the traditional limits of a junior level of government, or can they stretch their role to address fundamental questions and take bolder actions towards a truly just society? This book will explore elements of these questions for the city of Montreal, inspired by past and present experiences, in an effort to better frame the discussion. We will situate the present with an examination of the role of urban movements and community organizations and previous experiences of left municipal parties both in Montreal and from elsewhere.

"2019-11-30 14:24:48",Communication,"Towards a Lumpen Political Economy","Low-income people tend to be represented in academic texts, the media and art as pitiable victims, abject failures, as monstrous and/or as needing rescuing. Most sympathetic texts that deal with the political conditions of low-income peoples understand their political subjectivity as configured from their inclusion within the working class. However, I view this as inadequate. In doing this work alongside  the low-income community, I have struggled with an alternative analytical framework that positions the community and its members as agents with knowledge and experience that arises out of their distinct socio-economic position. I take up the term lumpenproletariat, popularized by Marx, as an analytical frame to help understand the complex social and economic life of the low-income community while recognizing that it is unwieldy, under-theorized and also highly stigmatizing. Currently, interest in the lumpenproletariat and their role of the in understanding capitalism, colonialism, the production of space and liberation movements is marginal. I take up Fanon and the Black Panthers in recovering and reinvigorating the theory of the lumpenproletariat and expand upon it as an intersectional category.
